I am a huge fan of reading books. Earlier, I would read a lot of fictional books but lately, I have been getting into
non-fiction books.

## Why Adventures in Bookland

I realized that although I was reading a lot of books with a lot of takeaways, I was forgetting the takeaways after a
while. This is an attempt to pen down my thoughts about the key ideas of the book.

## Structure

-   The book we read
-   A short summary of the book.
-   Key Takeways
-   A recommendation of whether I thought it was worth my time

## Join me on the adventure

Here, I endeavor to put down the key ideas from the books I read. Every book you will see is a book I have actually
read.

In the weeks that follow I'll be writing up posts for this series as I finish each book.

I hope you join me and I would love to hear your thoughts :)
