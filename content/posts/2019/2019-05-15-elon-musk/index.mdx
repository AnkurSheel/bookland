## Summary

This book gives a great insight into Elon Musk as a person as well as into his companies. It starts from Elon's
childhood and goes right up to the current status quo. It reveals the work ethic, the drive and the ruthlessness that
exists within Elon that helps him achieve his goals. As his ex-wife, Justine puts it (in the book) "He does what he
wants and he is relentless about it. Its Elon's world and the rest of us live in it.

Vance strikes a perfect balance between the personal and the professional life of Elon. He does not shie away from
detailing the various challenges and failures that Elon faced. An interesting thing that I learned was that Elon was the
inspiration for Downey's interpretation of Tony Stark. However, I felt that although Elon has been shown as an extremely
hard task-master with little empathy for his employees, the negative stories seem to have been glossed over. I wonder if
that was to keep the aura of Elon Musk intact.

## Recommendation

The book makes for a good read and has some interesting takeaways. However, I think it will be tough to apply them if
you do not have a similar personality like Elon. I also didnâ€™t like the fact that it glosses over the people challenges

I don't think it is a book that I will pick up again and again. However, It is worth reading it at least once
