## Key Takeaways

-   Simplicity takes work and insight to achieve.
-   If you are always worried about your immediate cash flow, how to make it to next week or the next pay period, you
    are very likey to make mistakes.
-   If you wait for more than a week to assign things to proper categories in your budget, you will begin to forget
    what's what.
-   You can't know what you are spending until you actually see the dollars and cents laid out right in front of you.
-   Dividing every expense into categories allows you to see the big picture.
-   Starvation budgets work no better than starvation diets. **Keyquote?**
-   An emergency fund is the basic foundation for having stability and calm.
-   Popular advice is if we just give up a \$5 small luxury a day, we can retire millionaires. But if that were all it
    took, most of us would be millionaires already.
-   Its better to save 1 percent consistently than try and dail over and over again to save 10 to 20 percent.
    **keyquote?**
-   There is no better way to simplify and gain control over your financial life than by eliminating high-interest debt.
-   The fastest way of ending your debt drama and getting off the debt treadmill is to devote your resources to paying
    down the bill with the highest interest rate while paying the required minimum on the rest.
-   After your emergency fund, saving for retirement is probably the most important savings you will ever undertake.
-   If your employer offers a retirement account with a match, this is likely the best shot you will ever get at earning
    money for doing absolutely nothing.
-   Dont fall for stories that you can invest in more funds or that it will be wasier to monitor your money if its all
    in one place.
-   Thats the thing about bubble and great market runs - Anyone can make money. Until times change or the bubble bursts.
-   People often forget to mention that not only is Warren Buffet an excellent stock picker but he also gets benefits
    from getting access to deals not available to mere run-of-the-mill investors like the rest of us.
-   One of the most important biases is the overconfidence that comes with expertise. No matter how much you study, no
    matter how much you learn, you will never be clairvoyant. And neither will anyone else. There are no market psychics
    out there.
-   "Alternative investments" is a nice way of saying â€œThis is a really risky investment that is hard to transparently
    value and that is subject to great swings in price.â€
-   We diversify to spread risk. The idea is that not everything in your investment portfolio rises and falls by the
    same amount at the same time.
-   There is no perfect investment scheme So how do you determine how much money you should put in stock market funds
    versus bond funds? Well, conventional advice for putting money in stock market funds
    1. Whatâ€™s your age?
    2. Subtract that number from 100.
    3. The answer is the percentage of your assets that should be invested in stocks.
-   If you put money only in supersafe assets that earn correspondingly low returns, such as a bank savings account,
    youâ€™ll increase your risk of outliving your money, not to mention actually losing money relative to inflation.
-   Stock investment Breakdown
    1. Seventy percent: A good S&P 500 index fund. assured quick diversification.
    2. Fifteen percent: A small-cap index fund. Small-cap funds have generally outperformed large-cap funds but have
       greater risk.
    3. Fifteen percent: A broad-based international fund. Make sure that you choose an international fund and not a
       "global" fund.
    4. Finally, if you donâ€™t own a house, condo, or other property, you might want to consider putting a small
       percentageâ€”maybe 5 to 10 percentâ€”of your money into a real estate investment trust index fund

-   A fiduciary is a financial advisor who has a legal and regulatory duty to put your interests ahead of his or her
    own.
    -   Never assume someone is a fiduciary. Never assume he doesnâ€™t ever work for commissions. Always ask. You want
        to seek out an advisor who works on a fee-only basis. This means the advisor is paid by youâ€”and only by you.
