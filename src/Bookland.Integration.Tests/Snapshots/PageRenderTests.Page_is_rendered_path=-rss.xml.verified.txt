			<content:encoded>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this book, Michael Hyatt provides a framework for a productivity system that helps us focus on optimising our life to do more of the right things (for us) rather than just more things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book has tips that can be put into practice with little effort as long as we are intentional about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="key-quote"&gt;Key Quote&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Productivity is not about getting more things done; it's about getting the right things done&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="key-takeaways"&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="what-are-the-different-types-of-freedom"&gt;What are the different types of freedom?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's what productivity gives you: the freedom to choose what you want to focus your time and energy on&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 4 different types of Freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The freedom to focus and do the deep work that creates a significant impact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The freedom to be present to our family and friends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The freedom to be spontaneous.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The freedom to do nothing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id="proficiency-and-passion"&gt;Proficiency and Passion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to be both passionate and proficient, or our energy and performance will suffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proficiency&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Passion&lt;/strong&gt; are the 2 criteria that can help us identify and filter our high leverage activity from low-leverage busy work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Passion&lt;/strong&gt; is the work we love, and that energizes us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our proficiency is best seen by other people&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proficiency&lt;/strong&gt; describes not only how well we actually do something but that we are also generating results that other people can measure and reward&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-4-zones"&gt;The 4 Zones&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can start by picturing a grid with &lt;strong&gt;Proficiency&lt;/strong&gt; running across the X-axis and &lt;strong&gt;Passion&lt;/strong&gt; running up the Y-axis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="zone-4-the-drudgery-zone"&gt;Zone 4: The Drudgery Zone&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you don't do is just as important to your productivity as what you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drudgery zone is made of tasks for which we have no passion and no proficiency.
This is the worst kind of work for us to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="zone-3-the-disinterest-zone"&gt;Zone 3: The Disinterest Zone&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just because you're good at something doesn't mean you should do it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disinterest zone is made of tasks that we are proficient at but arent that passionate about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we are not careful, we can get stuck in this zone because it pays the bills. But, doing the tasks that we are not passionate about takes away energy from what we are passionate about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="zone-2-the-distraction-zone"&gt;Zone 2: The Distraction Zone&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you must have the courage to tell yourself no too&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The distraction zone is made of things that we are passionate about but have little proficiency for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="zone-1-the-desire-zone"&gt;Zone 1: The Desire Zone&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True productivity is about doing more of what is in your Desire Zone and less of everything else&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The desire zone is where our passion and proficiency intersect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concentrating on these tasks allows us to do more high-leverage work in less time, enabling us to win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believe it or not, it's possible to stay in your Desire Zone but still work yourself to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should only delegate something in this zone if our Desire Zone has more tasks than we can reasonably do ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="zone-x-the-development-zone"&gt;Zone X: The development Zone&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This zone is outside the grid and helps us gauge work outside the desire zone but potentially moving towards it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we have a hunch we could develop passion and proficiency with a task, we should stay open-minded about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="notes"&gt;Notes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If something is outside our Desire Zone, we should at least stop and ask the question, "Could I eliminate this?"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-importance-of-rituals"&gt;The importance of Rituals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rituals offer us 3 key benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even though formulating rituals requires a lot of effort, that effort is needed only once. Once we have a system to apply the same solution to the same problem, we can focus on other things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rituals speed up our work as we don't have to think about the next step.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rituals prevent mistakes because designing rituals allow us to anticipate different failure points and build safety nets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-4-foundational-rituals"&gt;The 4 foundational rituals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When will you start and when will you finish?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morning&lt;/strong&gt;: Starts the moment we wake up to when we start work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workday Startup&lt;/strong&gt;: Starts as soon as we start work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workday Shutdown&lt;/strong&gt;: Starts as soon as we finish work. It's essential to review critical weekly and daily tasks as part of this ritual. We should also set our next day's tasks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evening&lt;/strong&gt;: Helps us wind down and get ready to sleep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workday startup and shutdown rituals are a great time to process our inboxes throughout the week, allowing us to get a jump on the day and then close any open loops before we break for the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If our team requires quicker feedback, we can do another inbox check before lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-3-categories-of-activities"&gt;The 3 categories of activities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id="front-stage"&gt;Front Stage&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are all the work-related tasks that deliver the result for which our boss and/or customers pay us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may or may not be done in public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="back-stage"&gt;Back Stage&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back Stage tasks are necessary for Front Stage performance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backstage work includes time for learning new skills to enhance our performance. They usually have some type of coordination. It also takes backstage time to prepare for front stage work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should schedule time for Back Stage activities as they will likely be less rewarding and exciting than Front Stage tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="off-stage"&gt;Off Stage&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do whatever it takes to safeguard your time Off Stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The off-stage is the time we are not working. It is crucial to restore our energy to work on the front and backstage tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="how-can-we-use-templates-for-productivity"&gt;How can we use templates for productivity?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time you work on a project, ask yourself, What components will I use again?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anytime we expect to do something more than once or twice, we should create a template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic concept of templates is to solve a problem once, write it down and then use it whenever we need it next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="process-automation"&gt;Process Automation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Process automation is a written, easy-to-follow set of instructions for performing a job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although they can seem similar to rituals, they are much more detailed and specific to a set of tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also need to remember that not all jobs lend themselves to documented workflows. Others might be outside our area of expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-5-steps-to-create-a-workflow"&gt;The 5 steps to create a workflow&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Its best to start with a simple workflow when starting out as we could get stuck and give up if we started with a complicated process.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="step-1-notice"&gt;Step 1: Notice&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step in creating a workflow is to pay attention to what we are doing each week and identify areas where a workflow could help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to think through each part of the entire procedure from start to finish and be meticulous in our detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="step-2-document"&gt;Step 2: Document&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to document every little thing on paper so someone who knows nothing about the process can execute it flawlessly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="step-3-optimize"&gt;Step 3: Optimize&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We review what we have written and ask ourselves three questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which of these steps can be eliminated?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which of these steps can be simplified?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which of these steps should be done in a different order?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to give the person following the workflow as much information as they need but not so much that they will skip steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="step-4-test"&gt;Step 4: Test&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to execute only what we have written down to see if we have missed anything when we test.  Testing what's on the document and only what's on the document will immediately reveal any holes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to keep correcting the workflow until we have a perfect, functioning process document that works as intended, no matter who's following it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="step-5-share"&gt;Step 5: Share&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is to share it and make sure anyone who might need it someday knows where to find it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to encourage people to make refinements to the workflow as they find gaps in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="delegation"&gt;Delegation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can't buy happiness, but you can buy back your time by offloading tasks you deem stressful or unlikable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delegation is a process and requires an investment of our time. It is not simply a matter of handing someone a task and some instructions and then reaping the rewards of the other person's efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delegation is not abdication. The outcome is still our responsibility. We will need to check in periodically to ensure things are progressing as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though delegation requires us to slow down to get a new person up to speed, in the long run, it frees up time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-5-levels-of-delegation"&gt;The 5 levels of delegation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn't enough to describe the ultimate outcome we want to achieve when delegating. We also need to specify how much authority and autonomy we are giving to the person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="level-1"&gt;Level 1&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Level 1 Delegation, we want the person to do precisely what we have asked them to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This level is perfect for new hires, entry-level people, or any other time we are clear on what needs to be done and just need someone to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example Phrase&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what I need you to do. Do not deviate from my instructions. I have already researched the options and determined what I need you to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here's what I need you to do&lt;/strong&gt;: We explicitly tell the person what we want them to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not deviate from my instructions&lt;/strong&gt;: This makes our expectations clear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I've already researched the options and determined what I want you to do&lt;/strong&gt;:  This provides the rationale and context for why we have chosen this level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id="level-2"&gt;Level 2&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Level 2 delegation, we want the person to examine or research a topic and report back to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This level can be used whenever we are not ready to decide and need someone to gather information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example Phrase&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what I need you to do. I want you to research the topic and report back with your findings. We will then discuss it, and I will make a decision and tell you what I want you to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here's what I need you to do&lt;/strong&gt;: We explicitly tell the person what we want them to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I want you to research the topic and report back with your findings&lt;/strong&gt;: We need to also clarify the level, type and scope of the research we want doing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We will then discuss it&lt;/strong&gt;: We are letting them know that we will have a conversation to discuss their findings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I will make a decision and tell you what I want you to do&lt;/strong&gt;: We are making sure they know that we will make the decision. This is important as we let the person know that they are not authorized to take any action or make any decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id="level-3"&gt;Level 3&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Level 3 delegation, we give the person more room to operate and participate in problem-solving. However, we still reserve the final decision for ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This level is excellent for delegating to future leaders because it gives us a safe opportunity to judge their decision-making skills without any risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example Phrase&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what I need you to do. Research the topic, outline the options, and then make a recommendation. Give me the pros and cons of each option, but tell me what you think we should do. If I agree with your decision, I will authorize you to move forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here's what I need you to do&lt;/strong&gt;: We explicitly tell the person what we want them to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research the topic, outline the options, and then make a recommendation&lt;/strong&gt;: We need to also clarify the level, type and scope of the research we want them to do. We are also asking them to evaluate the options pick one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give me the pros and cons of each option, but tell me what you think we should do&lt;/strong&gt;: We make it clear that they should not expect us to agree with their decision without first explaining why they made the decision they did.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If I agree with your decision, I'll authorize you to move forward&lt;/strong&gt;: If they have done their job well, we will give the final approval and permit them to move forward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id="level-4"&gt;Level 4&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Level 4, we want the person to evaluate the options, decide on their own, execute the decision, and then update us after the fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a great level to use with growing leaders because it empowers them with decision-making experience and gives us plenty of opportunities to evaluate how well they are doing. It's also a valuable level for assignments that aren't mission-critical and for which we don't have a strong preference regarding the outcome,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to be sure it's a person we can trust to act on our behalf. We should also not second-guess the decision they made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example Phrase&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what I need you to do. Make the best decision you can. Take action. Then tell me what you did. [Optional] Keep me apprised of your progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here's what I need you to do&lt;/strong&gt;: We explicitly tell the person what we want them to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make the best decision you can&lt;/strong&gt;: We explicitly ask them to decide after doing the research, evaluating the pros and cons, and exploring the best options.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take action&lt;/strong&gt;: We are making it clear that we expect them to act without waiting on us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me what you did&lt;/strong&gt;: This step is simply about keeping us informed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep me apprised of your progress&lt;/strong&gt;: This part is optional and is primarily helpful for projects with many moving parts or will take a long time to complete.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id="level-5"&gt;Level 5&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Level 5, we effectively hand the entire project or task over to someone else and exit the decision altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example Phrase&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what I need you to do. Make whatever decision you think is best. There's no need to report back or tell me what you did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here's what I need you to do&lt;/strong&gt;: We explicitly tell the person what we want them to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make whatever decision you think is best&lt;/strong&gt;: We explicitly ask them to make the decision after doing the research, evaluating the pros and cons, and exploring the best options.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There's no need to report back or tell me what you did&lt;/strong&gt;: We release them from any obligation to get back to us and officially exit the process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-7-steps-to-becoming-a-master-delegator"&gt;The 7 steps to becoming a master delegator&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real arrogance isn't delegating work we don't like; it's assuming everyone likes and dislikes what we do&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decide what to delegate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Match the task to the best person.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communicate the workflow and the result we need them to accomplish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide the necessary resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specify the delegation level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give them room to operate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check-in and provide feedback as needed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-importance-of-saying-no"&gt;The importance of saying NO&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever the reason, it is important to get comfortable saying no&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saying yes to one thing means saying no to something else. Even if we hate saying no, we must understand that every yes inherently contains a no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can evaluate the cost of saying yes by asking ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What will I have to give up to say yes to this opportunity?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will saying no to this allow me to say yes to something better?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also means turning down a ton of excellent and worthwhile ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="what-is-a-positive-no"&gt;What is a Positive No?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No” is rarely a popular response, but that doesn't mean it must be rude, undignified, or ungraceful. In fact, it's possible to say no in a positive way that leaves both you and the other person better off than either of you were before&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Positive No is a simple formula by William Ury with 3 parts: yes-no-yes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes&lt;/strong&gt;: Say yes to protecting what is important to us. This should also include affirming the other person. We don't want to shame others for thinking of us as a possible solution to their problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No&lt;/strong&gt;  The answer continues with a no that is clear and sets boundaries. We should not leave open the possibility that we might be able to do it another time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes&lt;/strong&gt;: We end the response by affirming the relationship again and offering another solution to the person's request. That way, we aren't taking on the responsibility ourselves, but we show our care and support by helping solve the problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="how-to-negotiate-out-of-an-existing-commitment"&gt;How to negotiate out of an existing commitment?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we have already committed to doing something, we should find a way to honour our commitment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we can attempt to negotiate out of the commitment using the following steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to take responsibility for making the commitment and not shift the blame or try to play dumb.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We should reaffirm our willingness to honour our commitment as refusing to follow through or help find a solution will damage our reputation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We should explain why honouring the commitment is not the best outcome for the other party. We need to focus on what's best for them, not us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We should offer to help find an alternative solution and clarify that we aren't walking out on our commitment until we find a mutually agreeable solution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id="importance-of-sleep"&gt;Importance of Sleep&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to give yourself permission to sleep as much as you find necessary to be at your best&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep is essential for high performance, but it's one of the first things we cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sufficient sleep keeps us mentally sharp and improves our ability to remember, learn, and grow. It refreshes our emotional state, reduces stress, and recharges our bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, going without sleep makes it harder to stay focused, solve problems, make good decisions, or even play nice with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can add a short nap to our daily schedule. But, it should not be longer than twenty or thirty minutes, or we might have a hard time waking up and will feel groggy, not reinvigorated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="eliminating-interruptions-and-distractions"&gt;Eliminating Interruptions and Distractions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While an interruption is an external force demanding our attention, a distraction is anything internal that disables or destroys concentration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An open-door policy sounds nice, but you'll never get any meaningful work done if you can't limit incoming access&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless we work in a customer service position, we should always opt for delayed communication. We should not engage in email or slack more than 2-3 times a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't wait for them to come find you; tell them in advance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we are limiting others access to us, we should proactively set their expectations by letting the relevant people know that we are going offline to focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="eisenhower-priority-matrix-popularized-by-stephen-covey"&gt;Eisenhower Priority Matrix popularized by Stephen Covey&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a simple grid divided into four quadrants in which the horizontal axis corresponds to urgency, the vertical to importance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="quadrant-1"&gt;Quadrant 1&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quadrant 1 indicates tasks that are both important and urgent for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does not mean tasks that are important and urgent to someone else but not necessarily to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="quadrant-2"&gt;Quadrant 2&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quadrant 2 refers to tasks that are important but not urgent right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can defer these tasks should also plan to attack them soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="quadrant-3"&gt;Quadrant 3&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quadrant 3 consists of tasks that are time-sensitive and important to others, but not necessarily to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should evaluate Quadrant 3 items on a case-by-case basis by asking ourselves 3 key questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are we putting Quadrant 1 or 2 items at risk by saying yes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What will we have to say no to say yes to this request?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will we end up resenting our participation or the other person if we agree?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4 id="quadrant-4"&gt;Quadrant 4&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quadrant 4 indicates tasks that are neither urgent nor important to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These should never make it onto our calendars or task lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="creating-an-ideal-week"&gt;Creating an Ideal week&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should design our lives first and then tailor our work to meet our lifestyle objectives&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start with an empty calendar for each day of the week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For each day, decide if it is Front Stage, Back Stage, or Off Stage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Divide each day into 3 blocks of time - morning, workday, and evening.
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For example, self in the morning, work in the midday, and rejuvenation in the evening.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Group the individual activities that will fall into the above themes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4 id="notes-1"&gt;Notes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't worry about making it perfect, and don't try to do this on top of our existing calendar appointments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoiding Back Stage work during Front Stage time is impossible, so we should schedule it and guard against its overflow into our Front Stage time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The exact tasks will change week to week depending on ongoing and one-off projects, but we should try to  group them as best as we can&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="weekly-preview"&gt;Weekly Preview&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By scheduling time to eliminate, automate, and delegate, you'll get far more accomplished than if you try to squeeze these activities into the margins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weekly review is a chance to reflect on our previous week and prepare for the next one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It enables us to keep track of all the tasks that we need to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List the things we accomplished and are most proud of in the previous week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go through the previous week and answer three questions.
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How far did we get on with our major tasks from the prior week?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What worked and what didn't?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What will we keep, improve, start, or stop doing based on what we just identified?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go through the deferred tasks - the tasks we intentionally decided to later and take one of the following actions
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eliminate&lt;/strong&gt;: Remove tasks that are no longer relevant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Schedule&lt;/strong&gt;: Put tasks that need to be done later on our calendar. We should try to batch similar tasks as much as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize&lt;/strong&gt;: For tasks that we want to work on this week but don't have a specific deadline, add it to the list of the 3 priority tasks for the week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defer&lt;/strong&gt;: For tasks that we still want to do but don't have time for this week, we can leave it on the list and consider it again during the following review.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review delegated tasks and see if we need to follow up with the person working on them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan through any notes that we have captured during the week and take one of the following actions
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eliminate&lt;/strong&gt;: Remove tasks that are no longer relevant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Schedule&lt;/strong&gt;: Put tasks that need to be done later on our calendar. We should try to batch similar tasks as much as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize&lt;/strong&gt;: For tasks that we want to work on this week but don't have a specific deadline, add it to the list of the 3 priority tasks for the week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defer&lt;/strong&gt;: For tasks that we still want to do but don't have time for this week, we can leave it on the list and consider it again during the following review.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review critical projects and deliverables for deadlines and list them by date to sequence our work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check our calendar and list upcoming meetings by date so that we can sequence our work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establish the 3 most important things (Weekly Big 3) we need to accomplish to progress our goals and projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Schedule time for rejuvenation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4 id="notes-2"&gt;Notes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can complete the weekly anytime we want, but the best times are Friday afternoon, Sunday evening or Monday morning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We should schedule it as a recurring 30-minute appointment on our calendar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="design-our-day"&gt;Design Our Day&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great days don't just happen; they are caused&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should aim for only three key tasks each day and let these be informed by our Weekly Big 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can choose our Daily Big 3 by selecting tasks that are in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;our Desire Zone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quadrant 1(important and urgent) of the Priority matrix&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quadrant 2(important, not urgent) of the Priority matrix&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to follow the priority matrix to deal with outside requests and other tasks, or our day will be overwhelmed by Quadrant 3 tasks (urgent to someone else, but not important to us).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="how-do-we-put-all-of-this-into-practice"&gt;How do we put all of this into Practice?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll never master how if you don't start by identifying what&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask what we want, how many hours we want to work, how many items we want on our task list, how many nights and weekends we want to work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List our regular tasks and activities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evaluate each item on the list by passion and proficiency and put them in the appropriate zone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For each task on the list that we did not classify as a Desire Zone activity,
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ask, "Does this really need to happen? Can I just eliminate it?
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove the obvious things that can be removed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;record the tasks we should not do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mark candidates for automation and pick one to tackle today.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delegate any tasks left in the Drudgery Zone that have not been eliminated or automated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delegate any tasks left in the Disinterest Zone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evaluate each task in the Distraction Zone by asking, "To what extent I am passionate about this? Is it worth parking this task in my Development Zone to see if I can hone my skills enough to move it into my Desire Zone"
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the answer is no, delegate it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design our 4 foundational rituals by indicating which activities we want to incorporate and how much time we will allow for each.
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then total those times to see how long it will take us to execute our rituals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plan an Ideal week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design our week and Day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eliminate Interruptions and Distractions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id="other-quotes"&gt;Other Quotes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best time to plan how to respond to a request is before that request ever hits your desk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just because you can wear all the hats in the business doesn't mean they all fit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You never have to land all your planes at once. Just because something is important doesn't mean it's important right now&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High performance for its own sake is just burnout waiting to happen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marathons are finished one stride at a time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multitasking doesn't feel slow. It actually feels fast, like we're flying&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="recommendation"&gt;Recommendation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed this book. There were a lot of tidbits in this book that I can apply to my life. Learning how to apply Rituals, Ideal Week and Weekly review made it a worthwhile use of my time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is suitable for anyone who is not managing their time optimally and would like to become more productive. However, if you are already designing your day and doing a weekly review, it may not be worth the time and effort.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content:encoded>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book explains the leadership concepts that have enabled SEAL leaders to achieve extraordinary results and translates them into lessons for business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each chapter in the book begins with a scene from the war in Iraq. The stories demonstrate the core principle to learn from the event. They then explain how the lesson learned is applied to a real-world business case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 4 Laws of Combat - the proper understanding and execution of which enable us to dominate the enemy and win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cover &amp;amp; Move&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prioritize And Execute&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decentralized Command&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="key-quote"&gt;Key Quote&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking ownership for mistakes and failures is hard. But doing so is key to learning, to developing solutions, and, ultimately, to victory&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="key-takeaways"&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-dichotomy-of-leadership"&gt;The Dichotomy of Leadership&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A leader has nothing to prove but everything to prove.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strive to be confident but not cocky&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A leader must be confident but not cocky. While confidence is an excellent attribute for a leader, overconfidence causes complacency and arrogance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who will not risk cannot win&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;John Paul Jones&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A leader must be willing to accept risk but must not be reckless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A leader must have a competitive spirit but also be a gracious loser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A leader must be attentive to details but not be obsessed with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A leader must be humble but not passive. They should stand up for the team and respectfully push back against a decision that could negatively impact success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaders who lose their temper also lose respect&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A leader must show a sense of anger, sadness or frustration, but they must control their temper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaders must never get so close that the team forgets who is in charge&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A leader should understand the motivations of their team members and know their people. But a leader must never grow so close to subordinates that one team member becomes more important than another or more important than the mission itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A leader must have the physical and mental endurance to perform at the highest level for the long term. But they must recognize limitations and know to pace themselves and their team to maintain a solid performance indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="characteristics-of-leaders-implementing-extreme-ownership"&gt;Characteristics of Leaders implementing Extreme Ownership&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the team is successful, then recognition will come for those in charge, but a leader should not seek that recognition&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaders must act with professionalism and recognize others for their contributions. They should not take credit for the team's successes but bestow that honour upon the subordinate leaders and team members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good leader does not gloat or revel in his or her position&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaders must post possess humility and the ability to control their ego. They must be confident enough to listen to others and follow someone else when the situation calls for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They must admit mistakes and failures and figure out a way to prevent them from happening again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People generally take the path of least resistance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When subordinates aren't doing what they should, leaders should not blame them. They should instead determine what they can do better to enable this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-importance-of-ownership"&gt;The importance of Ownership&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to take ownership of everything that went wrong. Despite the tremendous blow to my reputation and to my ego, it was the right thing to do - the only thing to do&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A leader has to take complete ownership of what went wrong, even if it means getting fired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subordinates or direct reports don’t expect their bosses to be perfect&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking complete ownership of the situation (even when things go wrong) will increase the trust with superiors. It will also increase the respect that direct reports have for us by proving that we possess the humility to admit and own mistakes and, most importantly, to learn from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-importance-of-planning"&gt;The importance of Planning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The true test for a good brief is not whether the senior officers are impressed. It’s whether or not the troops that are going to execute the operation actually understand it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A broad and ambiguous mission results in a lack of focus, ineffective execution, and mission creep. When plans are too complicated, people may not understand them. And when things go wrong, complexity compounds issues that spiral out of control into a total disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mission must be carefully refined and simplified so that it is explicitly clear. It should be specifically focused to achieve the greater strategic vision for which that mission is a part. The mission brief must explain the overall purpose and desired result of the operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Establishing an effective and repeatable planning process is critical to the success of any team&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While businesses can have their planning process, it must be a standard process so that other departments and supporting assets outside the company can understand and use the same format and terminology. It must be repeatable and guide users with a checklist of all the essential things they need to think about&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the planning process, we should explore how best to accomplish the mission with the available resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan must mitigate identified risks where possible, and there should be a plan for likely contingencies through each phase of the operation. We cannot reduce some risks, and we must focus on those risks that we can control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A leader’s checklist for planning should include the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analyze the mission.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decentralize the planning process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conduct post-operational debrief after execution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="decentralize-the-planning-process"&gt;Decentralize the planning process&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Team participation - even from the most junior personnel - is critical in developing bold, innovative solutions to problem sets&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is critical to utilize all assets and lean on the expertise of those in the best position to provide the most accurate and up-to-date information to facilitate the development of a thorough plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Team members never have as clear an understanding of the strategic picture as the senior leaders. Those senior leaders must impart a general understanding of that strategic knowledge(the why) to their troops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If frontline troops are unclear about the plan and yet are too intimidated to ask questions, the team’s ability to effectively execute the plan radically decreases&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leaders must encourage interaction during the planning process and ask questions to ensure their teams understand the plan. They should take the time to explain and answer the questions of subordinates so that they too can understand why and believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subordinates might not feel comfortable questioning leaders even though they are not worried about losing their jobs because they asked a question. But they can be concerned about looking bad in front of The Boss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giving all members ownership of even a tiny piece of the plan gives them buy-in and enables them to believe in the mission, which translates to far more effective execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="simple-plans"&gt;Simple plans&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your team doesn’t get it, you have not kept things simple, and you have failed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we develop the detailed plan, we must then brief the entire team in a simple, clear, and concise manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must brief to ensure the lowest common denominator on the team understands&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaders must carefully prioritize the information to be presented in as simple, clear, and concise a format as possible so that participants do not experience information overload. One way to accomplish this is by ending the briefing with the three most important things we want the team to remember and keep first and foremost in their minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is paramount that senior leaders explain to their junior leaders and troops executing the mission how their role contributes to big picture success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone who is part of the mission must know and understand their role in the mission and what to do in likely contingencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a leader, it doesn't matter how well you feel you have presented the information or communicated an order, plan, tactic, or strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even when leaders think the team understands the bigger picture, the team members are rightly focused on their specific jobs and often have difficulty connecting the tactical mission and the greater strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="cover-move-aka-teamwork"&gt;Cover &amp;amp; Move aka Teamwork&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the overall team fails, everyone fails, even if a specific member or an element within the team did their job successfully&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cover and Move means teamwork, and it is the most fundamental tactic. Each team member is critical to success, though the leader must identify the main and supporting efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Departments and groups within the team must break down silos, depend on each other and understand who depends on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="prioritize-and-execute"&gt;Prioritize And Execute&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all the pressing tasks at hand, if we don't address the most important one, nothing else will matter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is crucial for leaders to "pull themselves off the firing line", step back, and maintain the strategic picture so that they can help correctly prioritize for the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A leader cannot allow themselves to be overwhelmed. They have to relax and make a call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the most competent of leaders can be overwhelmed when confronted with the enormity of operational plans or try to tackle multiple problems simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to succeed, leaders must be comfortable under pressure and act on logic, not emotion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When things go sideways, a leader should remain calm, step back from their immediate emotional reaction, and determine the greatest priority for the team. Then, they should direct the team to attack that priority. Once the team is engaged in that highest priority effort, they can then determine the next priority. Rinse and repeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A particularly effective strategy is to stay at least a step or two ahead of real-time problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intelligence gathering and research are important, but they must be employed with realistic expectations and must not impede swift decision&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waiting for the 100 per cent right and certain solution leads to delay, indecision, and an inability to execute. Leaders must be prepared to make an educated guess based on previous experience, knowledge of how the enemy operates, likely outcomes, and whatever intelligence is available in the immediate moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of how you think an operation is going to unfold, the enemy gets their say as well—and they are going to do something to disrupt it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teams must maintain the ability to see other problems developing and recognize when the highest priority task shifts to something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="decentralized-command"&gt;Decentralized Command&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In chaotic, dynamic, and rapidly changing environments, leaders at all levels must be empowered to make decisions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decentralize command means trusting team members to analyze possible courses of action and make adjustments and adapt the plan to unforeseen circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A true leader is not intimidated when others step up and take charge. Leaders that lack confidence in themselves fear being outshined by someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a leader, if we are down in the weeds planning the details with our guys, we will have the same perspective, which adds little value. But if we let them plan the details, it allows us to stand back and see everything from a different perspective, which adds tremendous value. We can then see the plan from a greater distance, and as a result, we will tighten up the plan by catching mistakes. This enables us to look like a tactical genius, just because we have a broader view.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decentralized Command does not mean that team members operate on their own program; that results in chaos. Instead, they must fully understand what is within their decision-making authority. Additionally, they must communicate with senior leaders to recommend decisions outside their authority and pass critical information up the chain so the senior leadership can make informed strategic decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to practice decentralized command?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brief the plan to all participants and supporting assets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delegate portions of the plan and brief to key junior leaders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continually check and question the plan against emerging information to ensure it still fits the situation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id="how-to-empower-junior-leaders"&gt;How to empower Junior Leaders?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senior leaders must constantly communicate and push information to their subordinate leaders. They must be heavily engaged in training and mentoring their junior leaders to prepare them to step up and assume greater responsibilities. They should not micromanage them but instead, give them clear guidance about what the expectations are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, you need to walk away from a problem and let junior leaders solve it, even if you know you might solve it more efficiently. It is more important that the junior leaders can make decisions and backed up even if they don’t make them correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Junior leaders must have implicit trust that the boss will back them up even if they make a decision that may not result in the best outcome, as long as they made a decision in an effort to achieve the strategic objective. Without this trust, junior leaders cannot confidently execute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="post-operational-debrief"&gt;Post Operational Debrief&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A post-operational debrief examines all phases of an operation, from planning through execution, in a concise format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It addresses the following for the combat mission just completed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What went right?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What went wrong?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can we adapt our tactics to make us even more effective and increase our advantage over the enemy?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such self-examination teams to reevaluate, enhance, and refine what worked and what didn't to constantly improve and adapt their methods and implement lessons learned for future missions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often business teams claim there isn't time for such analysis. But one must make time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="team-performance"&gt;Team Performance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no bad teams, only bad leaders&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must make teams of manageable elements of four to five operators, with a designated leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaders need to provide the forcing function that teams need to get the different members working together to accomplish a mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a teams performance is low, we should&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;recognize and accept that the team's performance is terrible and has to get better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not blame anyone or make excuses to justify poor performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not wait for others to solve the team's problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;believe that winning is possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to standards, as a leader, it’s not what you preach; it’s what you tolerate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When setting expectations, no matter what has been said or written, if substandard performance is accepted and no one is held accountable, that poor performance becomes the new standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="leading-up-the-chain"&gt;Leading up the chain&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading up the chain takes much more savvy and skill than leading down the chain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When leading up the chain of command, we cannot fall back on our positional authority. Instead, we need to exercise caution and respect. We must use influence, experience, knowledge, communication and maintain the highest professionalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't ask your leader what you should do; tell them what you are going to do&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As junior leaders, we must be proactive rather than reactive. We should tell higher authority what we plan to do, rather than ask, “What do you want me to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For missions that need a superiors approval/support, we must push the necessary information up the chain so that the superior is comfortable and gives us approval. If they still have significant questions, we are not doing a good enough job of getting the information. We must push situational awareness up the chain to their senior leaders to keep them informed, particularly of crucial information that affects strategic decision making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaders must support their own boss&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must also realize that our boss must allocate limited assets and make decisions with the bigger picture in mind. Our team may not represent the priority effort at that particular time, or perhaps the senior leadership has chosen a different direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If our boss isn't deciding on time or providing necessary support, we shouldn't blame the boss but ourselves. We should see what we can do to convey the critical information better and better clarify, educate, influence, or convince that person to give us what we need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we do the small things without complaining, we build trust with our superiors. This gives us credibility to push back on the stuff that matters and to get whatever we need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="dealing-with-micromanagement"&gt;Dealing with Micromanagement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To take charge of minute details just to demonstrate and reinforce to the team a leader’s authority is the mark of poor, inexperienced leadership lacking in confidence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people micromanage because of their egos. They want to do one of two things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they want to exercise their power over a person&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they want to show off their knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get them to stop micromanaging us, we need to put them at ease. We can put the micromanagers at ease by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working hard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Showing them how responsible we are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Showing them what a good handle we have on the situation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not only giving them all the information they want but sending them more information than they could ever want&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting better at the job so that they trust us and move on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="stepping-into-a-leadership-role"&gt;Stepping into a leadership role&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To lead people, we need to build relationships with them. We can do that by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;being humble.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;treating everybody with respect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;listening to others and then making a good decision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By having integrity and telling people the truth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;passing the reward and the credit on to our team. when things do go right,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the insecure leader that you need to watch out for. The insecure leader is always worried about looking bad&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we step up to lead, it can be very intimidating for the person above us, and that is the last thing we should want. We can avoid this by for example, if we develop a plan, we can let them think it is theirs by appearing to seek guidance or approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should make sure that we aren't stealing our superiors limelight. Instead, we want them to get all the credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="dealing-with-doubts"&gt;Dealing with doubts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a leader does not believe, he or she will not take the risks required to overcome the inevitable challenges necessary to win&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A leaders actions and mindset carried great weight among subordinates. To lead, i.e. convince and inspire others to follow, we cannot share doubts with subordinates because they will question their own belief in the mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any chain of command, the leadership must always present a united front to the troops&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaders in any chain of command will not always agree. But once the debate is over and the boss has made a decision - even if that decision is one you argued against - we must execute the plan as if it were our own&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good leaders don’t make excuses. Instead, they figure out a way to get it done and win&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we ever get a mission that we don’t believe in, we should not just sit back and accept it. We must take a step back, deconstruct the situation, analyze the strategic picture, and then conclude. If we still don't understand or believe in the decisions coming down from our leadership, we should ask questions up the chain of command until we understand why so that we can believe in what we are doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can ask the questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why? Why are we being asked to do this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is winning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="asking-good-questions-as-a-leader"&gt;Asking good questions as a leader&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s actually a sign of insecurity if you can’t ask when you need help with something&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t need to know everything. What we need to do is go in and ask good questions. This is not an excuse to not know anything at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re secure in your leadership, you’re fine to ask some questions. It’s not that big of a deal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go and say, “I’ve never done this procedure before,” or, “I’ve never done work with this piece of equipment before. Can you show me how to use it? Because I want to make sure I understand. I want to make sure I get it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="discipline"&gt;Discipline&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discipline starts with the little things: With that, the more important things fall into place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have the discipline to get up early, you are rewarded with more free time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we want extra time, we need to make that time. One way to make time is to get up early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="trust"&gt;Trust&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trust is not blindly given. It must be built over time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can build trust by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;having open conversations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overcoming stress and challenging environments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working through emergencies and seeing how people react.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaders should demonstrate that they will take care of the team and look out for their long-term interests and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ego"&gt;Ego&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A person’s biggest strength can be his greatest weakness when he doesn’t know how to balance it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone has an ego. Ego drives the most successful people in life. They want to win, to be the best. That is good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When ego clouds our judgment, then ego becomes destructive. It can prevent us from conducting an honest, realistic assessment of our performance. Ego or personal agendas does not drive the best leaders. They focus on the mission and how best to accomplish it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="dealing-with-other-leaders"&gt;Dealing with other Leaders&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we approach another leader as if they did something wrong, need to fix something, and are at fault, it becomes a clash of egos, and we two will be at odds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, if we put our ego in check, meaning we take the blame, that will allow them to see the problem without their vision clouded by ego. Then we both can make sure that our team’s standard operating procedures—when to communicate, what is and isn’t within their decision-making authority—are clearly understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="other-quotes"&gt;Other Quotes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leadership decisions are inherently challenging and take practice. Not every decision will be a good one: all leaders make mistakes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only meaningful measure for a leader is whether the team succeeds or fails&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of all leaders should be to work themselves out of a job&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deep meaning of responsibility: the leader is truly and ultimately responsible for everything&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you aren’t winning, then you aren’t making the right decisions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a leader, you want to be seen - you need to be seen—as decisive and willing to make tough choices&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leadership is simple but not easy. Likewise, leadership is both art and science&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effective leaders lead successful teams that accomplish their mission and win. Ineffective leaders do not&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give them what they need and try to help them if you can, but it sounds like they will make their own bed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="recommendation"&gt;Recommendation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a solid book and has some good insights, especially within the narrative of war stories. If that is not your cup of tea, you can probably give some sections of the book a miss. Other leadership books cover some of the evident management principles, but they take on a different meaning when viewed through the lens of Extreme Ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extreme Ownership is an excellent read for leaders at all levels.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content:encoded>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic premise of "Take the Stairs" is that we live in a world of people who want to take the easy way in their pursuit of success. The book drives home the reality that self-discipline is necessary to achieve success and that there is no easy path to success. As the author says, it's about taking the stairs instead of the escalator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book focuses on understanding and coming to grips with emotions that prevent us from achieving success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is broken down into 7 parts, and each piece has a bunch of short stories and inspirational anecdotes. There are also some action items at the end of the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="key-quote"&gt;Key Quote&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rent Axiom: Success is never owned, it is only rented — and the rent is due every day&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="key-takeaways"&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="decisions"&gt;Decisions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are only 2 types of activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;things we feel like doing because it makes us feel good; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;things that make sense logically but don't make us feel good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sacrifice isn't really a sacrifice at all; it's just a short-term down payment on a rich future blessing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of people make decisions based on emotions and impulses. However, making decisions based on what feels good in the short term requires more work in the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successful people form the habit of doing things that failures don't like doing"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Albert Gray&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-discipline is the ability to take action regardless of our emotional, physical or financial state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to popular belief, it is not about doing things the hardest way possible; instead, it is about doing the hardest thing as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often it is not making the wrong decision that has the greatest cost, but choosing indecision that does&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of spending our time trying to make the right decisions, we should instead start making decisions and then making them right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, we should be asking &lt;em&gt;"How"&lt;/em&gt; instead of &lt;em&gt;"Should "&lt;/em&gt;. We should make a list of all the things in our life that are "should-do's" and identify which ones are important enough to be converted into "How will I do's?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A challenge in respect to today is a big problem. A challenge in respect to our life span is a small problem. A challenge in respect to eternity is no problem&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a long term perspective allows us to make better decisions. It empowers us with the conviction of knowing that things will work out if we put in the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faith, therefore, is also choosing to believe that all that is happening today — good or bad — is part of an ultimately greater plan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we do everything that we can, and things still don't work out the way we had hoped for, then we can be sure that they were definitely supposed to go the way they did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="time-and-energy"&gt;Time and Energy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Becoming successful requires not only physical energy but also emotional energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often the emotional energy of a decision is greater than the physical energy needed for executing the decision. It is the reason why so many of us give up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peace of mind comes from falling in love with the fact that there is simply and certainly always going to be more to do than we have time for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With so many options, deciding how best to spend our time is a significant cause of stress today. Having a schedule allows us to focus our energy on the tasks at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By offloading the thought process of deciding what activities we should or shouldn't spend time on when we are in a logical state, we can avoid spending the time and energy on figuring out what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take pride in controlling the activities that are within your power and to let go of the worry and fear attached to the results that are not&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our natural instinct is to want to see the results right away, but there is a gap between the work we put in from being on schedule and when the results start to show up. This delay explains why people often have a hard time sticking to their schedules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important skill for the next generation of knowledge worker is not learning what to do but rather determining what not to do&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should write out a detailed schedule of what our ideal week would look like right now and our ideal week in five years by filling it in the following order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rocks&lt;/strong&gt;: Start by allocating the time for the harvest periods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pebbles&lt;/strong&gt;: Thing like sleep and work-meetings around them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sand&lt;/strong&gt;: Things like email catchup and office time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Water&lt;/strong&gt;: Whatever is left and whatever we want to do&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="harvest-periods"&gt;Harvest Periods&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;quote quote="The biggest problem with the notion of balance is that it causes us to ask the wrong questions. Instead of asking, &amp;quot;Am I spending enough time on this. activity?&amp;quot; we should really be asking, &amp;quot;When is the best time to be focused on this activity?"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of us try to spend equal time on all our activities. But it is better to spend appropriate time on critical priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In business what you don't get done today can be done tomorrow, but with family what doesn't get done today is gone forever&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should have &lt;strong&gt;"harvest periods"&lt;/strong&gt; in some primary areas of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Family&lt;/strong&gt;: Have one weeknight dedicated as a private date night with a spouse or a child—even if it can only happen with each person once a month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fitness&lt;/strong&gt;: Do some physical activity every day and work out hard for 30 minutes a day three times per week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faculty&lt;/strong&gt;: Have at least one uninterrupted night per week dedicated to a personal hobby.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finances&lt;/strong&gt;: Review all of our up-to-date financial account balances every Sunday night.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="focus-and-procrastination"&gt;Focus and Procrastination&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the absence of disciplined focus, we become strangely loyal to performing daily acts of trivia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Anonymous&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focus is minimizing the amount of distraction. To achieve focus, we need to manage our thoughts, our words and our behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most important ways to focus our thoughts is to make the first and last thoughts of the day that inspire us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Distraction is a dangerously deceptive saboteur of our goals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 3 types of procrastination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Classic Procrastination&lt;/strong&gt; is consciously delaying what we know we should be doing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creative avoidance&lt;/strong&gt; is unconsciously filling the day with menial work by taking things that aren't important and making them urgent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Priority dilution&lt;/strong&gt; is when we take urgent things and inappropriately makes them essential.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who are struggling with procrastination have one of the following attitudes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m scared to do it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We don't challenge ourselves to test our limits because we are afraid, aka &lt;strong&gt;FEAR(False Evidence Appearing Real)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shouldn't have to do it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We believe that we are entitled to a life that is supposed to be easier, aka &lt;strong&gt;Entitlement&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won't try to do it if I can't do it right&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We don't take on a challenging task because at least we know we won't fail. So we wait for the perfect plan, the perfect time, and the perfect resources, aka &lt;strong&gt;Perfectionism&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Law of E. F. Hutton — when the real leader speaks, people listen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;John Maxwell&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three ways to get people to take action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first is to ask them to do it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second is to force them to do it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The third is to help them recognize for themselves why it's in their best interest to take a particular course of action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="vision"&gt;Vision&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was doing things right, but I wasn't doing the right things&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A vision is an inspiring mental picture that propels us to take action. The clarity of what we want, in the long run, is directly proportionate to the levels of our endurance, our intensity of focus and discipline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can make a vision board by cutting out inspiring images from magazines and pasting them on a poster board. We shouldn't worry about how it will look to others. We should update the pictures every couple of months to keep them inspiring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="commitments"&gt;Commitments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A life of average, or a life of mediocrity, doesn't come from having a bad attitude. A life of average comes from having an average attitude&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should commit to an endeavour until we have maximized our potential then and only then we should evaluate the decision to leave it to try something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we are genuinely committed to an endeavour, there is no chance of turning back because of the unacceptable consequences of doing so. Either the stakes are too high, or the turning back isn't an option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For unacceptable consequences to be effective, they should be ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does not matter what we say we believe; our real beliefs are revealed by how we act&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conditional commitments also us to have flexibility in our lives and be involved in many activities. This works only if the parties involved have a good understanding of what the boundaries are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The foundation of a disciplined life is integrity and doing what we say we're going to do&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saying either &lt;em&gt;"I will do..."&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;"No, I'm sorry; I can't commit to that."&lt;/em&gt; are much harder to make, but they are much more powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to making commitments to other people, sometimes one of the hardest things to learn to say is no when we mean no&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intellectual dishonesty is simply allowing someone to believe something that we know is not true. It is tricky to spot because it's not something we say; it's what we don't say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can inrease our accountability cultivating it in four different relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supervisor&lt;/strong&gt;: a boss or highly respected mentor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subordinate&lt;/strong&gt;: an employee or mentee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significant&lt;/strong&gt; other: a spouse, family member, colleague, best friend, or other trusted peer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supporter&lt;/strong&gt;: a more objective outside third-party partner who will bring a unique unbiased perspective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="impact-of-words"&gt;Impact of Words&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Words carry tremendous power if they are chosen with care and intention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the significant causes of pain is that most people don't realize the impact of their words on themselves and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time we fail to come through on something we said we would do, we weaken the power of our words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compliments create a dynamic of loyalty and positive change&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans have a deep desire to be correct. By genuinely acknowledging someone for an admirable trait or a job well done, we satisfy this desire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever you say the word "but", you are negating whatever you said before it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word &lt;em&gt;"But "&lt;/em&gt; is a (subconscious) trigger to the listener that everything that came before that word is meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most damaging times to use the word "but" is when giving feedback or compliments. We might think that we are softening our criticism, but it weakens our praise and our word in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tell people everything they need to know, and not a word more&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;David Brooks&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consequences of gossip are not limited to just the instigator or the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It usually negatively affects those passing it along or even those trying to help by getting in the middle of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When two people are in conflict, we should take charge of the situation by making them talk directly to one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saying whatever we feel and think without first filtering it through the lens of how it might impact the people around us is not transparency; it's indulgence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can harness the power of our word with the following guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thinking before speaking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choosing our words carefully&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doing what we say we will.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being where we promise we will.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resisting the urge to use emotionally charged language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assuming the "mic is always on" and that everyone will hear everything we say.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using empowering language when speaking about ourselves and others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="other-quotes"&gt;Other Quotes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winning is a habit; unfortunately so is losing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Vince Lombardi&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being successful doesn't happen by falling into the most desirable situation possible and somehow magically being discovered for some special uniqueness we have that no one else does&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That which is recognized is repeated&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Christine Roland&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ignore the noise. Conquer the critical. Manage the minutiae&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discipline creates freedom, but timing is everything&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Randy Gage&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="recommendation"&gt;Recommendation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is easy to read and is ok if you are looking for inspiration, but there is not much to learn. There is nothing new that you would not have already read in other inspirational books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</content:encoded>

			<content:encoded>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building a Storybrand is a guide for creating effective marketing messages. The book discusses how we can use critical elements that make a compelling story to stop bombarding our prospective customers with marketing noise that doesn't resonate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is divided into 3 stages and has actionable steps to create our Brandscript&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="key-quote"&gt;Key Quote&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you confuse, you’ll lose&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="key-takeaways"&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="what-is-the-importance-of-a-story"&gt;What is the importance of a story?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where there’s no story, there’s no engagement&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To connect with customers, we need to have clear messaging and not generate noise. A story is the best way to combat noise because it takes random events and organises them so that people are compelled to listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="what-is-the-storybrand-framework"&gt;What is the Storybrand framework?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In every great story, a &lt;strong&gt;Hero&lt;/strong&gt; encounters a &lt;strong&gt;Problem.&lt;/strong&gt; At the peak of their despair, they meet a &lt;strong&gt;Guide&lt;/strong&gt; who gives them a &lt;strong&gt;Plan&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Calls them to Action.&lt;/strong&gt; That action helps them avoid &lt;strong&gt;Failure&lt;/strong&gt; and ends in &lt;strong&gt;Success.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The storybrand framework is based on this and identifies the following 7 principles for communicating a clear message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The customer is the hero, not your brand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Companies tend to sell solutions to external problems, but customers buy solutions to internal problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customers aren’t looking for another hero; they’re looking for a guide&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customers trust a guide who has a plan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customers do not take action unless they are challenged to take action&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every human being is trying to avoid a tragic ending.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never assume people understand how your brand can change their lives. Tell them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id="what-are-the-mistakes-that-we-make-with-our-messaging"&gt;What are the mistakes that we make with our messaging?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we think we are saying to our customers and what our customers hear are two different things. And customers make buying decisions not based on what we say but on what they hear&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few critical mistakes that we make when crafting our offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People will always choose a story that helps them survive and thrive&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We fail to focus on the aspects of our offer that will help people survive and thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In every line of copy we write, we’re either serving the customer’s story or descending into confusion; we’re either making music or making noise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our offer does not have a single focus. In our desire to cast a wide net, we make the message so vague that potential customers cant understand our offer. This confusion causes our customers to tune us out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don't talk about the cost of not doing business with us, and when we do, we make 2 mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have too many warnings about imminent doom, which causes the customers to resist us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have too few reasons, and the customers don't know why our product matters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="how-to-create-our-message"&gt;How to create our message?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could a caveman look at your website and immediately grunt what you offer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to answer 3 questions and communicate them simply so that the story we are inviting customers into has a definition and direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do you offer?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How will it make my life better?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do I need to do to buy it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more we talk about the problems our customer's experience, the more interest they will have in our brand&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must tell customers what life looks like(for them) after they engage with us and how they will feel after their problem is resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to address the 3 levels of problems a customer encounters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;External problems&lt;/strong&gt; is the physical/tangible problem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internal problems&lt;/strong&gt; are the frustrations that are caused by external problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Philosophical problem&lt;/strong&gt; answers the question "Why?" and gives our customers a more profound sense of meaning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brands that don’t warn their customers about what could happen if they don’t buy their products fail to answer the “so what” question every customer is secretly asking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to talk about the cost of not doing business with us is. The best way to do this by creating a villain with personified characteristics that our products or services defeat. The villain should be relatable, singular and real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must tell our customers how great their life can look if they buy our products and services&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should see if our brand can promise a resolution for one or more of these desires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Need for Status&lt;/strong&gt; by making our customers more esteemed, respected, and appealing in a social context&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Need for Something External to Create Completeness&lt;/strong&gt; by reducing stress or providing a tool that they are missing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Need to Reach Our Potential&lt;/strong&gt; by inviting customers to participate in a more significant movement or helping them accept themselves as they are&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="how-to-position-ourselves-as-a-guide"&gt;How to position ourselves as a guide?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your customer should be the hero of the story, not your brand. This is the secret every phenomenally successful business understands&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we help our customer solve a problem (even for free), we position ourselves as a guide. By positioning our customer as a hero and ourselves as a guide, we become a trusted resource to help them with their problems. The next time they encounter an issue in that area of their lives, they will look to us for help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To position ourselves as a guide, we must demonstrate empathy and authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="how-do-we-show-empathy"&gt;How do we show Empathy?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customers won’t know you care until you tell them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three things that every human being wants is to be seen, heard and understood. Customers trust brands that understand them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To express empathy, we simply need to let our customers know that we understand their problem and would like to help them find a solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="how-do-we-show-authority-aka-competence"&gt;How do we show Authority, aka Competence?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The customer simply needs to know that you have something they want and you can be trusted to deliver whatever that is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 4 ways to show authority - Testimonials, Statistics, Awards and Logos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customer testimonials are one of the best ways to illustrate how we help our customers transform. Testimonials should be brief and should avoid endless praise. We also don't need more than three testimonials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awards help in earning a customers trust even if they have never heard of the award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logos of other customers that we have helped can help provide social proof that we can help them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="what-questions-can-we-ask-for-a-compelling-testimonial"&gt;What questions can we ask for a compelling testimonial?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a compelling testimonial, we need to ask the right questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the questions we should ask are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What was the problem you were having before you discovered our product?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What did the frustration feel like as you tried to solve that problem?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What was different about our product?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take us to the moment when you realised our product was working to solve your problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell us what life looks like now that your problem is solved or being solved&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id="how-to-use-plans-to-encourage-customers-to-do-business-with-us"&gt;How to use plans to encourage customers to do business with us?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not having a plan is a guaranteed way to confuse your customers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All effective plans either clarify how somebody can do business with us or remove the sense of risk somebody might have about working for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should give our plans a title that increases the perceived value of our product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 2 types of plans we can use - Process plans and Agreement plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="what-is-a-process-plan"&gt;What is a Process Plan?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Process plans help to alleviate confusion by describing the steps that a customer needs to take to buy our product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If our customers might have trouble imagining how they would use our product after buying it, we can create a post-purchase plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A process/post-purchase plan should have between 3 to 6 steps. If there are more than 6 steps, we should break down the steps into stages and describe them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="what-is-an-agreement-plan"&gt;What is an Agreement Plan?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agreement plans help customers overcome the fear they might have about doing business with us. An agreement plan clarifies the shared values between our customer and us. It can increase the perceived value of a service we promise to provide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can create an agreement plan by listing all the things (related to our product) our customer and then counter that list with agreements to alleviate their fears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-should-we-have-on-our-website"&gt;What should we have on our website?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People don’t read websites, they scan them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a website, the images and text above the fold are the things you see and read before you start scrolling down. The images and text we use above the fold should either promise to solve a problem or promise an aspirational identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to communicate a sense of satisfaction with our product is by displaying happy customers engaging with the product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fewer words you use, the more likely it is that people will read them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There should be very few words on our website. We should see if we can replace some of our text with images or reduce paragraphs using bullet points or summarise sentences into bite-sized soundbites. If we need a long section of text to explain something, we can place a "Read More" link at the end of the 1st or 2nd sentence so that people can expand it if they like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to great writing isn’t in what they say; it’s in what they don’t say&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should have a bold and legible one-liner. It is the obvious statement that viewers read and invites potential customers into a story they find interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There should be one prominent button to press, and it should be the direct call to action. This does not mean that there should be only 1 button but rather 1 button that stands out by being a different colour (preferably brighter). This button should be placed in 2 prominent places on the website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the top right corner of the website and it shouldn't be cluttered with other buttons; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the centre of the screen above the fold and should be repeated as people scroll down the page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transitional call to action should also be obvious, but it should not distract from the direct call to action. It can be a less-bright button next to the call to action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="how-to-create-a-one-liner"&gt;How to create a One-Liner?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customers don’t generally care about your story; they care about their own&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A one-liner is a single statement that answers the question "What do you do?" and helps people realise why they need our product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It needs to answer the following questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who is your customer?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is their problem?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is your plan to help them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What will their life look like after you do?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A one-liner needs to be tested repeatedly and is not complete until people ask us for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="how-to-create-a-direct-call-to-action"&gt;How to create a Direct Call to Action?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A call to action involves communicating a clear and direct step our customer can take to overcome their challenge and return to a peaceful life&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A direct call to action is something that leads to a sale, or at least is the first step down a path that leads to a sale. The wording of this action should position our product as a resolution to the external, internal, and philosophical problem that our customer faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fastest way to grow a company is to make the calls to action clear and then repeat them over and over&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They can be included everywhere to make it very clear what we’d like customers to do: to make a purchase so we can help them solve their problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="how-to-create-transitional-calls-to-action-and-collect-e-mail-addresses"&gt;How to create Transitional Calls to Action &lt;strong&gt;and Collect E-mail Addresses&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our customers may not need our product today, and they might not need it tomorrow, but on the day they do need it, we want to make sure they remember who we are, what we have, and where they can reach us&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transitional calls to action usually offer a customer something for free. They can be used to “on-ramp” potential customers to an eventual purchase. An excellent transitional call to action can stake a claim to our territory and create reciprocity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lead generator is a resource that magnetically attracts people to our businesses. It invites them to join our mailing list to let them know, directly and authoritatively, how we can help them resolve their problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the highest level, the most important challenge for business leaders is to define something simple and relevant their customers want and to become known for delivering on that promise. Everything else is a subplot that, after having delivered on the customer’s basic desire, will only serve to delight and surprise them all the more&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lead generator should offer something more valuable than the vague offer of a newsletter and establish us as an authority in our field. An effective lead generator has an irresistible title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few ways we can create lead generators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A free PDF of a maximum of 3 pages educating customers about our field of expertise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online Course or Webinar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free Samples of our product&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A limited-time free trial&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="how-to-create-a-nurturing-campaign"&gt;How to create a &lt;strong&gt;nurturing campaign?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like farming a field, building a healthy and engaged e-mail list takes time, but it’s time well spent. Start today. A year from now, you’ll be glad you did&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nurturing campaign is a simple, regular e-mail that offers your subscribers valuable information related to your products or services. The idea is to provide something of great value and then occasionally ask for an order and remind people you have products and services that can improve their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A typical nurturing campaign may have an e-mail going out once each week. So it's recommended to create a few months worth of material and then adding to it as we get time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An excellent way to craft each nurturing e-mail&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talk about a problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explain a plan to solve the problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Describe how life can look for the reader once the problem is solved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Include a postscript or the P.S. Often, the P.S. is the only thing somebody who opens a mass e-mail will read.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we try to sell passively, we communicate a lack of belief in our product&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About every third or fourth e-mail in a nurturing campaign should offer a product or service to the customer. This e-mail looks a little different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talk about a problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Describe a product you offer that solves this problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Describe what life can look like for the reader once the problem is solved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Call the customer to a direct action leading to a sale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content is important, but the point is, there is great power in simply reminding our customers we exist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't worry if the open rates on these e-mails are low. Even if a person sees and deletes the e-mail, the goal has been accomplished. If someone unsubscribes, that's a good thing as they would probably never buy from you anyway, and it reduces the size of your list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="how-much-value-should-i-give-away-for-free"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Much Value Should I Give Away for Free?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s never cost me to give away valuable, free content. People consume this content on the run and will gladly pay to attend a workshop or hire a facilitator that helps them slow down and learn the information at a custom-created pace&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't be worried about giving away too much free information. The more generous a brand is, the more reciprocity they create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="how-to-create-a-system-that-generates-referrals"&gt;How to create a system that generates referrals?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To generate referrals, we need to create a system that invites and incentivises customers to spread the word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The steps to create an effective referral system&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify our existing ideal customer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give our customers a reason to spread the word by creating a PDF or video that we automatically send.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offer a reward to existing clients who refer their friends or an affiliate program with a 10% commission&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="a-template-e-mail-to-send-to-customers-with-the-pdfvideo"&gt;A template e-mail to send to customers with the PDF/video&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Friend,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for doing business with us. A number of our clients have wanted to tell their friends about how we help customers, but they aren’t sure how to do so. We’ve put together a little video that will help your friends solve X problem. If you have any friends with X problem, feel free to send it along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’d be happy to follow up with any of them, and we’ll be sure to let you know whether we could help. We know you value your relationships, and so do we. If your friends are experiencing a problem we’ve helped you solve, we’d love to help them too. If there’s anything else we can do, please let us know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Name&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. X Problem can be frustrating. If you’d rather introduce us to your friend in person, just let us know. We are more than happy to meet with them in their place of business or at our office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="other-quotes"&gt;Other Quotes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If nothing can be gained or lost, no one cares&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a reason most marketing collateral doesn’t work. Their marketing is too complicated. The brain doesn’t know how to process the information&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Mike McHargue&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty websites don’t sell things. Words sell things&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brands that position themselves as heroes unknowingly compete with their potential customers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People don’t buy the best products; they buy the products they can understand the fastest&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="recommendation"&gt;Recommendation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering this book is about marketing and crafting a compelling message, it is no surprise that it is exceptionally well written. It is organised in a very easy to follow way. This book is not only for marketers and copywriters. It is a must-read for anyone else that wants to help people connect with their brand more effectively. It can help clarify our message, organise our thoughts and simplify our marketing.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content:encoded>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is your motive to take a leadership position? Is it because it’s the next step on the organisational ladder, or is it to get the opportunity to serve? This book aims to challenge us to look at our motivations for leading. It also looks at how the two types of leaders handle 5 different responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is divided into 2 distinct parts - a business fable and a practical description of the model. Most of the book is a fictional story that presents a conversation between 2 ceos on how to be a good leader. The model extracts the lessons and drive the point home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="key-quote"&gt;Key Quote&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please don’t be a leader, unless you’re doing it for the right reason, and you probably aren’t!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="key-takeaways"&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="what-are-the-different-types-of-leaders"&gt;What are the different types of leaders?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 2 types of leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibility-Centered Leader&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leadership is meant to be a joyfully difficult and selfless responsibility&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responsibility centred leaders believe that being a leader is a responsibility and serving others is the only proper motivation for leadership. They believe that it is their responsibility to do the most mundane and uncomfortable jobs. Keeping the organisation moving in the right direction is their actual job. They understand that the experience of leading is challenging and that sacrifice and suffering are inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reward-Centered Leader&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their motto might well be “It’s good to be the king.” And few “kings” want to be managers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reward centred leaders believe that being a leader is the reward for hard work. They are drawn by the attention, status, power and money that it brings. They think that a leader's experience should be pleasant and that they should be able to choose what they work on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="why-do-reward-centred-leaders-not-make-good-leaders"&gt;Why do &lt;strong&gt;reward centred leaders not make good leaders?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are doing the things you like to do. You aren’t doing the things your company needs you to do&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reward centred leaders won't embrace the demands of leadership. They will pick and choose how they spend their time and energy based on what they will get rather than what they need to do as a leader. They will avoid the unpleasant situations and activities that leadership requires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="how-the-different-types-of-leaders-deal-with-different-situationsresponsibilities"&gt;How the different types of leaders deal with different situations/responsibilities?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team Development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responsibility centred leaders actively build their team. They take part in the emotional and uncomfortable conversations that team-building always involves, even though they may not look forward to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reward centred leaders don't see team development as being important. They stay involved in the technical areas but let someone else deal with the conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Managing Subordinates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leadership can never be about the leader more than the led&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responsibility centred leaders help individuals set their work's general direction and stay informed enough to identify problems as early as possible. They also coach individuals to make it more likely that they will succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reward centred leaders use trust or a persons seniority as an excuse for not managing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Having Difficult and Uncomfortable Conversations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Management is the act of aligning people’s actions, behaviours, and attitudes with the needs of the organisation and making sure that little problems don’t become big ones&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responsibility centred leaders confront difficult and awkward issues quickly and with clarity and resolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reward centred leaders avoid difficult conversations by claiming not to have time or energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Running Great Team Meetings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can’t delegate that job. It’s yours and yours alone&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responsibility centred leaders understand that the most important discussions and decisions take place in meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reward centred leaders don't realise that by accepting bad decisions, they are making bad decisions and not talking about the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communicating Constantly and Repetitively to Employees&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[The very best leaders] They see themselves as CROs—chief reminding officers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responsibility centred leaders see it as a tool for helping others understand and internalise essential ideas. They recognise that it is an emotional and behavioural process more than a transactional and informational one. It requires repetitive and tedious work from a leader. They are more concerned about employees being uninformed than they are about being criticised for redundancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reward centred leaders worry that they’re going to insult their audience by repeating a message. They fail to appreciate that the purpose of communication is not their entertainment, nor is it simply the dissemination of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="will-i-be-considered-a-micro-manager"&gt;Will I be considered a micro-manager?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only people who call it micromanagement are employees who don’t want to be held accountable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. The goal is not to do our people's job. Instead, we are coaching them and making sure they have a good plan. It's also a way to know about any significant issues before it's too late to do anything about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="how-to-have-difficult-and-uncomfortable-conversations"&gt;How to have difficult and uncomfortable conversations?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Failing to confront people quickly about small issues is a guarantee that they will become big issues&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can emulate Alan (Mulally)'s approach to holding people accountable using his technique of '&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;joyful accountability&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;'. Alan liked to approach people who needed correction and cheerfully let them know that it was entirely up to them whether they changed their behaviour or attitude. He would remind them that he would still be their friend if they couldn't change, but they couldn’t continue to work at Ford or Boeing. He meant what he said and was neither passive-aggressive nor condescending when he said it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can reassure people that we are not questioning their intentions. Suppose they seem uncomfortable or concerned with something we have said. In that case, we should see if we can ease their concerns by explaining ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="how-to-receive-advice"&gt;How to receive advice?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’d be a fool if you weren’t sceptical. That’s the only way you’ll eventually buy in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though we might not like the idea of admitting any weakness, we should not want to lose out on advice that other people might have for us. We need to acknowledge that they might know something we don't. But if they don't, thank them for their time and be the bigger person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="misc"&gt;Misc&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is tolerated at the top of a company is often the ceiling of what can be expected deeper within it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responsibility centred leaders need to be careful of comparing themselves to reward centred leaders and eventually lowering their standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people we lead will not tell us the truth about our behaviour. It's important as leaders to surround ourselves with people who will be honest with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should know what the most crucial part of our job is. This should not be based on a quantitative breakdown of our time but on what we do to help the business. We should also know if we enjoy the day-to-day stuff of being a leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building an organisation starts by changing the behaviour of the leaders, which leads to behavioural change in the rest of the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="other-quotes"&gt;Other Quotes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no such thing as communicating too much about the important stuff&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we don’t understand why we’re leading in the first place, none of it will make sense&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No reasonable human being has ever left a company because management communicated too much&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[The] plan was the plan, and his job was to keep his company focused on it, not to move from one flavour of the month to another&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Alan Mulally&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="recommendation"&gt;Recommendation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is exceptionally well written. Even though it is short, the leadership lesson is powerful. I think everyone who is either a leader or looking to move to a leadership position should read this book. It challenges us to look at our motivations for leading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</content:encoded>

			<content:encoded>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Art Of Learning is Josh Waitzkin’s autobiography dealing with his rise to the top of the chess and the martial arts world. It gives an insight into the mindset and training of a world champion. Not only does it talk about learning (as implied by the title) but also other topics such as parenting, coaching, dealing with chaos and unfair situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="key-quote"&gt;Key Quote&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are clear distinctions between what it takes to be decent, what it takes to be good, what it takes to be great, and what it takes to be among the best&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="key-takeaways"&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="what-are-the-different-theories-of-intelligence"&gt;What are the different theories of intelligence?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every loss is an opportunity for growth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 2 theories of intelligence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entity Theorists&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entity theorists see their overall intelligence as a fixed entity. As children, they tend to have been told that they did well when they succeeded and that they weren't good at something when they failed. As a result, they are more prone to quit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incremental / learning Theorists&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incremental theorists believe that they can become good at anything with hard work. As children, they have been given process-oriented feedback and have learnt to associate effort with success. As a result, they are more likely to rise to the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="what-can-we-do-as-parentscoach"&gt;What can we do as parents/coach?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important for a parent to be empathetic and inspiring and to make sure that their child knows that they would be loved regardless of the outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a parent, we also need to choose the right teacher for our child especially since a lot of teachers are incentivised for short term wins over a long term approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to get to know the student and build a rapport. Once we have gained their trust, we should let them express themself and not suppress their natural voice by forcing them into cookie-cutter moulds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confidence is critical for a great competitor, but overconfidence is brittle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though we might want to praise all the decisions made by a student (especially if they are young) to build confidence, we need to remember that it discourages objectivity, encourages self-indulgence and creates a dishonest relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than feeding them information, we should let them make important decisions and ask them to explain their thought process regardless of whether the outcome was good or bad. The introspective thinking can result in a healthy coping mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short term goals can be useful as long as they are balanced with a long term philosophy. But, the regular feedback should respond to effort over results. When the student loses, we shouldn't say "it doesn't matter" but instead show empathy. Focusing only on wins can make a child terrified of shattering the facade of perfection. However, remember that it is important to enjoy a win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to make the relationship to the game about learning and passion rather than the competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="how-can-we-pursue-excellence"&gt;How can we pursue excellence?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is rarely a mysterious technique that results in success but a mastery of a basic skill set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intuition makes uncanny connections&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is critical to integrate new ideas, experiments and knowledge in a manner that is in sync with our personality. The effects of moving away from our natural voice can be disturbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common error is to take on too much at once&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to begin with the fundamentals and get a solid foundation of the principles of our discipline. Once we are comfortable with the fundamentals we can add more complicated manoeuvres in a step by step manner so that we can maintain the sense of ease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have to be able to do something slowly before we can have any hope of doing it correctly with speed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it's a physical discipline, we can slowly and incrementally condense our movements. The key is to take small steps to refine our timing and precision so that the body can barely feel the condensing practice and repeating each step over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growth comes at the expense of previous comfort or safety&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We grow by pushing ourselves and finding what lies at the outer reaches of our abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tactics come easy once principles are in the blood&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to take breaks from competitive intensity and allow protected periods of cultivation. There are 2 reasons for this. First, we need time to internalize new skills before we can improve. Secondly, players who can relax in brief moments of inactivity can handle the pressure much better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="how-can-we-respond-to-chaos"&gt;How can we respond to chaos?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter how much preparation we do, in the real tests of our lives, we’ll be in unfamiliar terrain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to learn how to dictate the tone of battle and that involves knowing how to avoid being distracted by random unexpected events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good competitors tend to rise to the level of the opposition&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to learn how to use emotion to our advantage. If we take on the mentality of a victim then half the battle is already lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unconscious mind is a powerful tool, and learning how to relax under pressure is a key first step to tapping into its potential&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An error can trigger fear or confusion that muddies the decision-making process. But, we need to remember that its the not the first mistake but the subsequent mistakes that prove disastrous. Being able to regain presence and clarity of mind after making an error can turn losses into wins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we rely on having no nerves then when the pressure is high enough, or when the pain is too piercing to ignore, our ideal state will shatter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 3 critical steps in learning how to respond to chaotic situations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have to learn how to be at peace with imperfections.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use that imperfection to our advantage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create little jolts in our consciousness so that we are constantly inspired whether or not external conditions are inspiring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id="how-can-we-achieve-incremental-growth-by-relaxation"&gt;How can we achieve incremental growth by relaxation?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to start by creating a natural routine that is relatively portable and makes us feel positive. Once we have fully internalised the routine, we can do it before important events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is to gradually alter the routine so that it is similar enough to have the same effect but slightly different so that the trigger is both lower maintenance and flexible. Again the key is to make the changes incrementally so that the body can barely feel the difference from the last version of the routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="misc"&gt;Misc&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s amazing how much you can learn about someone when they get caught in the rain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People can reveal nuances in their character in the more mundane moments&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If both players are aware of a tell, then it will be neutralized, made ineffective, and others will have to be unearthed and exploited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To always be prepared for exertion by being nourished without having a full stomach(and thereby dull our) senses, we can eat five almonds every forty-five minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="other-quotes"&gt;Other Quotes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should not expect the rest of the world to understand what it takes to become the best that we can become&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The road to success is not easy or else everyone would be the greatest at what they do&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great ones are willing to get burned time and again as they sharpen their swords in the fire&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your goal is to be mediocre, then you have a considerable margin for error&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To win, to be right, to have everything under control. This ultimately cripples growth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you know what good feels like, you can zero in on it, search it out regardless of the pursuit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="recommendation"&gt;Recommendation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not a big fan of the book. As an autobiography, its a fine read with a moderately compelling story. It shows how he has tackled and solved many problems that he faced to reach the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although different principles appear in the book it is a little light on tips and it isn't always clear how they can be applied. I also felt that most of them do not apply to other disciplines that don't have rigid rules and where it might be better to collaborate rather than compete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would give it a miss unless you are interested in the world of chess or martial arts and how Josh became the best in those 2 fields.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content:encoded>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meetings are critical for making decisions. But we dread meetings because most of them are bad. In "Death by Meeting", Patrick Lencioni shows us how we can change the bad meeting culture. He draws a comparison between meetings and movies and how it's surprising that even though meetings have more potential to be more interesting, they are not. He offers practical advice to make our meetings more interesting and effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is divided into 2 distinct parts - a business fable and a practical description of the model. Most of the book is the fictional story which presents common scenarios with meetings at the workplace along with the solutions in an easy to digest framework. The model extracts the lessons and drive the point home,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="key-quote"&gt;Key Quote&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is at once shocking and understandable that intelligent people cannot see the correlation between failing to take the time to get clarity, closure, and buy-in during a meeting, and the time required to clean up after themselves as a result&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="key-takeaways"&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="why-do-we-hate-meetings"&gt;Why do we hate meetings?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meetings are a puzzling paradox. On one hand, they are critical. Meetings are the activity at the centre of every organization. On the other hand, they are painful. Frustratingly long and seemingly pointless&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of us hate going to meetings because they are boring and ineffective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meetings are boring because they lack drama or conflict. Most leaders think that they are helping by avoiding tension and ending meetings on time but they are the root cause of bad meetings. Not only does this reduce employee interest but also ensures that the unresolved issues will result in unproductive personal conflicts or dare I say politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meetings are ineffective because they lack structure and most of them don't allow for the participants to engage in productive debates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should come as no surprise that bad meetings lead to bad decisions. But there is a more intangible cost which manifests itself in the form of anger, lethargy or cynicism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="good-meetings"&gt;Good meetings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good meetings result in good decisions by extracting the collective wisdom of a team&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other side of the spectrum, good meetings result in higher morale, faster and better decisions which leads to better results. Although they can seem to be unproductive, they accelerate decision making by eliminating the need to revisit issues again and again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="how-to-make-a-meeting-interesting"&gt;How to make a meeting interesting?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a simple formula to make meetings interesting - Get people hooked in the 1st 10 minutes, then mine for ideological conflict and drive it to a conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has to be something ultimately at stake&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have to get peoples attention at the beginning. Luckily, this isn't too hard. People are generally used to be being bored at meetings. In the 1st 10 minutes of a meeting, the participants need to understand and appreciate what is at stake. People are looking for a reason to care and the leader's job is to give them that reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a group of intelligent people come together to talk about issues that matter, it is both natural and productive for disagreement to occur&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make meetings less boring, leaders need to provoke relevant and constructive ideological conflict. This leads to more passionate and provocative discussions which keep the people engaged. Leaders need to look for places where people have different opinions and then force them to communicate what they are thinking until they have said all there is to be said. They can minimize the discomfort by reminding the participants that what they are doing is good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A consensus is usually not achievable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the leader decides that all of the information has been aired, its time to make a decision. The leader takes the final decision only if no has been able to make a compelling enough argument for making a decision. Everyone needs to understand that once a decision has been made everyone has to support it regardless of their original position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="how-to-make-a-meeting-effective"&gt;How to make a meeting effective?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When properly utilized, meetings are actually time savers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to what we might think, the length of a meeting has nothing to do with its effectiveness. We need to have multiple types of meetings which each have their purpose, format and timing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 5 types of meetings that we should have&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daily Check-in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weekly Tactical meeting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monthly Strategic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ad-hoc Strategic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quarterly off-site review&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="daily-check-in"&gt;Daily Check-in&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have to do what we have to do&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a 5-10 minute meeting every morning. There is no agenda because everyone juts reports on their activities for the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It clarifies how the priorities are translated into action on a daily basis. But, more importantly, it is a quick forum to ensure that nothing falls through the cracks on a given day and people are not stepping on each other's toes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we are just getting started with this type of meeting, it is important not to cancel any, even if some members are missing. We should also commit to doing them for 2 months before evaluating whether they are working or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="weekly-tactical"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weekly Tactical&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do we need to talk about today so that we can make as much progress as possible this week?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a weekly meeting to focus on tactical issues that must be addressed for short term success. It runs for 45-90 minutes. The agenda is decided during the meeting and is based on what everyone is working on. To ensure that we know where to focus, the agenda should be based on both our activities as well as the metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main goal of this meeting is to identify and remove any obstacles and make sure everyone needs to be on the same page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to come up with a real-time agenda?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A sixty-second report by each participant on the three primary activities. We want to keep it short because too much information would be distracting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A 5-minute report of any critical information and the key metrics for success.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Based on the above, set the real-time agenda.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to limit the conversation to issues that have an impact on tactical issues and goals. Trying to deal with the strategic issues in a weekly meeting just results in distractions. Its almost impossible for people to shift from a tactical mindset to a strategic one. What it means is that we won't deal with any of the short term issues that need to be resolved to keep the business moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If someone raises an issue that is too big, put it on the list for the next monthly meeting. Complex issues need time and there is just not enough time in this meeting to dive into a big issue and have a complete and satisfying conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="monthly-strategic"&gt;Monthly Strategic&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complex topics deserve enough time for brainstorming, analysis, even preparation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a monthly meeting to focus on strategic issues. Agendas are critical for these meetings so that people can think about the topics beforehand. We can pick between 1-3 topics as long as we pick the right ones. There is no set time for this meeting but we should schedule about 2 hours per topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to pick a topic?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important topics should be obvious. But, if they are not, we can follow these steps in a prior meeting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone writes down 1 issue that they think would be good to discuss and gives a 60-second pitch of why their idea should make the cut.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone gets 2 votes which can be used on 1 idea or split between 2. But, we can't vote for our idea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Appoint someone to be in charge of organizing the research for each topic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We shouldn't put too many items on the agenda. Sometimes only 1 topic matters and we need to have the discipline to limit ourself to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to learn to distinguish between topics that can be addressed by a subset of the team and those that are critical to the entire team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ad-hoc-strategic"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ad Hoc Strategic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is similar to a monthly strategic but it is only for a critical issue raised in a weekly tactical that cannot wait for the next Monthly Strategic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to know how to identify the rare strategic issues that deserve immediate attention and not have an ad-hoc meeting for every issue that comes up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="quarterly-off-site-review"&gt;Quarterly off-site review&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effective off-sites provide executives an opportunity to regularly step away from the daily, weekly, even monthly issues that occupy their attention, so they can review the business in a more holistic, long-term manner&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quarterly off-site review is a chance to get away from the grind and review things from a distance. It should be scheduled for 2 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main purpose is to reflect on and discuss the state of the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examples of Topics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anything that has a long-term impact that cannot be discussed in the weekly or monthly meetings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Giving each other feedback&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See if our strategy still makes sense&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Figuring out who our best people are and how to manage the stragglers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Competitive and Industry Review&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should we get a facilitator?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advantage of getting a facilitator is that it allows the leader to participate in the discussions without having to play a more supporting role. But we need to find someone who is a good fit. Someone who takes the time to learn the business and helps without trying to prove how smart they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many offsite meetings contribute little lasting benefit to an organization. We have to remember that the purpose is not to entertain the attendees but to allow them to step back from the daily distractions. We should also be careful to not over-structure the meetings and provide the attendees with presentations and white papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="other-quotes"&gt;Other Quotes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company’s culture would come to mirror those meetings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bad meetings start with the attitudes and approaches of the people who lead and take part in them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing more painful than confronting an uncomfortable topic is pretending it doesn’t exist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bad meetings at the executive level usually indicated a huge gap between performance and potential&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="recommendation"&gt;Recommendation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book was a compelling read and read more like a fictional story. I think everyone who is frustrated with meetings should read this book. It provides simple and realistic steps to make meetings more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content:encoded>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most smart people prefer to do nothing rather than make the wrong decision. When confronted with a long list of options, people just want to be told what to do. This makes creating a financial plan overwhelming. Others don't want to own up to their past mistakes. Some just want to live for today and don't want to create plans or have goals. Others have a goal but no idea on how to reach them. Others are so focused on the goal that they forget to enjoy their life and end up being disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these people need a financial plan. It is the best way to give ourselves more time. After all, if we don't know what our goals are and where we are today, how can we get to where we want to be tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A one-page financial plan is different from traditional financial plans because it represents only 3-4 things that are most important to us along with some action items to achieve our goals. In his book The One Page Financial Plan, Carl Richards shares the steps to make a good one-page financial plan that is customised for us. He also shares some tips and tricks to get on top of our finances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="key-quote"&gt;Key Quote&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you can plan, you have to know why you’re planning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="key-takeaways"&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="what-makes-a-good-financial-plan"&gt;What makes a good financial plan?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good financial plan is a way to get clear on what's important to us and a way to achieve our goals. It needs to answer the question "&lt;strong&gt;What's the stuff that matters?&lt;/strong&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we might think of goals as only being financial, a good plan will not have activities that have a monetary benefit but detract us from the other forms of human capital - energy, time and skill. It can prevent us from making our goals seem unattainable because we have inflated the numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life isn’t just about retirement&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good financial plan should not be set in stone because circumstances change and life doesn't always go as planned. Because a good financial plan is not a plan for the rest of our life, it should be a way of evaluating whether we are on track to meet our goals or if we need to make adjustments. If we are not adjusting our plan, we are probably ignoring issues that might become problems in the future&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="creating-our-one-page-financial-plan"&gt;Creating our One Page Financial Plan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we start making our financial plan, we need to keep a few things in mind. The conversations associated with making a financial plan can be emotional and therefore :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to pick a time when we have energy and are feeling fresh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to have the conversation (with our partner) in a neutral place and not in a place that has memories associated with it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We should not bring up past mistakes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing your values can make it easy to say no to things that distract us from what’s most important&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step of creating a one-page financial plan is to know where we are today and where we want to be. Answering the following questions can help us figure out the 3-4 things that are important to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is money important to us?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This question uncovers our deepest desires and fears and reveals the reason why we have the goals we have. It helps us understand our values which will help us make better financial decisions by giving us clarity on which strategies to employ. Although the purpose of asking "&lt;strong&gt;Why&lt;/strong&gt;" isn't to come up with specific goals or actions, we should still strive for specifics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do we spend our time and money?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way we spend our money and time can be a good indicator of what we value. By asking this question, we might also realize that we are spending money and/or time on things that don't matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are our major financial goals and How badly do we want it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important goals will involve a sacrifice. This sacrifice is always worth it for the right goal so if the goal is right for us, we will be willing to make the sacrifice. If we think the goal is not possible, then it is maybe not the right goal for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t be committed to the guess, be committed to the process of guessing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is to set some specific goals that we want to achieve. It is difficult to have specific goals when we don't know what the future is and are making assumptions. But it is still important to take our best guess at each goal even if we don't get it exactly right. Unfortunately, most people don't guess because they are afraid of making the wrong guess. Along with how much it will cost, we also need to guess that by when we would like to achieve it. We should make sure we set goals for how we want to live in the next year, next 5 years and the next 10 and not just for retirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we have specifc goals, we need to rank each goal by its importance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its important to remember that althiough we have created specific goals we shouldn't obsess about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to ask ourselves "&lt;strong&gt;If we were to retire today, how much money would we need per month to live the way we had hoped?&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="how-to-deal-with-disappointments"&gt;How to deal with &lt;strong&gt;disappointments&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t the story I wanted to tell, but it was the truth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are times when life won't go as planned and circumstances can derail our best-laid plans. Remember that problems are never quite as bad as it seems and we can always make some changes to get back on track. By remembering whats important to us and by focusing on things that we can control, we can gain clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also need to remember that our irrational decisions and bad money calls are not failures but something we can learn from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="why-do-we-need-to-save"&gt;Why do we need to save?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Save as much as you reasonably can. Spend less than you earn&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest reasons that we don't save is our need for instant gratification. There are very very little things that we need to buy right now but we buy it because we want it. To justify our purchase, we look for evidence and omit anything that doesn't support the purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to save because if we spend more than we earn, we will eventually end up in debt. There are a few tools in the toolbox that we can use to take back control of finances&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Budgeting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;72-hour test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eliminating Debt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automate Savings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="budgeting"&gt;Budgeting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can’t plug holes if you don’t know they exist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of us dislike budgeting is because it requires discipline which is hard and people tend to avoid hard things. Some of us also think that it is about denying ourselves pleasure. But, spending a lot of money on something is not necessarily bad as long as it aligns with our goals and values. This makes budgeting a process of separating what is important(to us) from what isn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Budgeting helps us cultivate the awareness to save and spend according to our values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do we get started with budgeting?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Track everything you spend&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic rule of budgeting is to track everything we spend because that is the only way to know where our money goes. Nothing will change till we change our behaviour which can only happen if we are aware and take responsibility for all the unnecessary purchases that we make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tools don't matter. Use whatever tools that work for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning, review your spending at least once a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automating any long-term savings goal will remove the question of whether you should spend the money or save it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="hour-test"&gt;72 Hour test&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do no not give into your urge for instant gratification&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a great tool to stop impulse buying, Instead of buying something immediately, we should wait for 72 hours or keep it in our shopping cart if we are buying online. Most of the time, we will forget about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to remember that we are not saying "No". We are just not giving in to our urge for instant gratification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="eliminate-debt"&gt;Eliminate Debt&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who understand interest earn it. People who don’t pay it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting rid of debt is one of the best investments we can make because it is an investment with a guaranteed return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have eliminated debt, you should put all one time windfalls into savings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="automate-savings"&gt;Automate Savings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could have the best investing strategy in the world, but if you don’t have any money to invest, it won’t help you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automating any long term saving goals that we have decided on will remove the question of whether we should spend or save our money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="investing"&gt;Investing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investing is one of those cool, rare things where we actually get rewarded for being lazy. Once you get it right, the less you do, the better&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a correlation between risk and reward but when it comes to investing, we want to take on &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;systematic risk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; which is based on the assumption that regardless of whether the stock market is up or down, it will continue to grow. One way of doing this is by spreading our risk by diversifying our portfolio. After all, any plan needs to account for the reality that markets go down as well as up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should try to keep our costs as low as possible because the more we pay for our investments, the less we will end up keeping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A default portfolio is good to get started but it doesn't take into account our situation, our goals and our ability to stick with a plan when the markets are crashing or even how much risk we can handle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should rebalance once a year and if we can we should automate the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key when it comes to investing is to stick with it or it will be a wasted effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="how-do-i-hire-a-financial-advisor"&gt;How do I hire a financial advisor?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be worthwhile to hire a good financial advisor to help us make unemotional decisions about our portfolio and provide a check and balance to our decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good financial advisor will be asking us a lot of questions to figure out why money is important to us and what our goals are before telling us what we should do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are open about conflicts of interest. A conflict of interest doesn't mean its something bad but it is important to be aware of. There are a few questions that we can ask to uncover a conflict of interest&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much do I pay you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, it will be a clear stated amount and we will know exactly how much we need to pay and when.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How are you compensated?&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Do you get paid (or win) anything based on the products you recommend to me?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="do-i-need-life-insurance"&gt;Do I need life insurance?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's the surprises that cause the heartburn&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is full of risks but we should only get insurance for the risks that we want someone else to take care of. If someone else depends on us, we should get a life or preferably term insurance. Term insurance simply means that we lock in the cost for a specified period. Once the period is over the policy lapses and hence we want to get the longest policy that we think we will need based on our age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before deciding how much we should insure for, we need to separate the economic need from the emotional loss. The goal is to have as much as we need but not more. A good rule of thumb is that it should be 25 times the amount we will need to replace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="can-i-afford-to-buy-a-house"&gt;Can I afford to buy a house?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never sat down to figure out what it would take to make this work. I just wanted to believe our real estate agent, despite the fact that he was making money on the deal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should not assume that we must own a house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should not buy a house if we are buying it solely for tax purposes or because of what we think the house might be worth someday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few questions that we can ask ourselves to see if we can afford to buy a house&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have we saved enough for a down payment?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can we afford it after factoring in additional costs like property taxes, home-owner association fees and utilities?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can we qualify for a loan?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How long do we plan to live in the house?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If its less than 5 years, it is not worth it. 5-10 years and we can consider it. More than 10 years and the numbers will probably be in our favour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="other-quotes"&gt;Other Quotes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A big part of being human involves irrationality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The calendar and the checkbook never lie - old saying&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can be fun to imagine ourselves striking it rich by hitting on the right stock at the right time. But the odds that it’ll happen are so small that I wouldn’t plan on it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We won’t have enough money to reach all of our goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="recommendation"&gt;Recommendation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter what your age, if you are just getting started with getting your financial life in order, this book is a refreshing read. By taking away a lot of the complexity that comes with getting started with a financial plan and reducing it a few questions, it makes it very easy to get started.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content:encoded>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is based on the premise that to grow an efficient and profitable business, you need to take the profit before paying expenses. This approach works for both new and existing businesses. At the end of each chapter, Mike suggests some actions that you can take to achieve a profitable business. He shares many examples of entrepreneurs who have applied the Profit First methodology scenarios as well as examples of how to apply the system. For some of the techniques, he also gives some advanced strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book starts by giving you a way to assess your business and setting up accounts to get started with the Profit First Technique. It then gives a roadmap to continuously apply the profit first technique on a regular cadence. The book also shares some tips on reducing expenses, personal finance, handling layoffs and finance for kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="key-quote"&gt;Key Quote&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue is vanity, profit is sanity, and cash is king&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="key-takeaways"&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A business is made up of 5 components
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Income
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The total revenue of the business&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Profit
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Profit distributions to all the equity owners&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Owners Compensation
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The amount all the equity owners take as pay&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tax
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The direct tax liabilities of the business and the personal income taxes of the owners&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Operating Expenses
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All other expenses required to run the business&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most businesses fail because of lack of profitability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Real Revenue is the money that your company makes after paying for material and subcontractors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For each full-time employee, your company should generate a Real Revenue of $150K-$250K&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For a tech business, real revenue should be 2.5 times the labour cost&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For a cheap labour field business, Real revenue should be 4 times the labour cost&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Growth is only half the equation. It is an important half but still only a half&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The perfect size of your business will happen naturally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want at least a 5% profit allocation to have a minimum buffer to keep your business afloat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A higher (current) profit allocation percentage implies higher efficiency in running the business which means less in operating expenses. eg
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5% profit allocation = 3 weeks of operating cash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;12% profit allocation = 2 months of operating cash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;24% profit allocation = 5 months of operating cash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The goal of every business is health and that is achieved through efficiency not by cutting owners compensation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have at least a 3-month reserve&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Figure out how to consistently be profitable and then do everything to grow that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assess your business by comparing your Current Allocation Percentages(CAP) against the Target Allocation Percentages(TAP)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cancel whatever you don't need to run your business efficiently or to keep your customers happy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Negotiate every expense except payroll&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Challenge yourself to go just 1 more day without the item that you need to purchase. Sometimes, you will discover that you no longer need the item.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parkinson's Law&lt;/strong&gt;: The demand for something expand to match its supply. It triggers 2 behaviours when supply is scant
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You become frugal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You become innovative and find ways to get maximum value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thinking that something good will happen just because we work harder, longer or better does not work in real life. It just happens in the movies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to become the best at one thing i.e. mastering the process of delivering perfectly and efficiently rather than trying to do a large variety of things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To grow the biggest, you need to determine what you are best at and do it even better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you believe that achieving a number is possible, you will achieve it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You must pay yourself first even if you are in debt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get rid of bad clients who want your least profitable products and services because you are losing money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every time your income increases, set aside at least half of the increase as savings and you can use the rest for lifestyle upgrades.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember to celebrate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More revenue does not mean that you are more successful, what matter is Profit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maximize Profit regardless of the current size of your business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accountants define Profit as a number at the bottom of an accounting report. We just need to define it as &lt;strong&gt;Cash in the bank&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To keep big margins, you have to make the most of it when you have them and keep innovating to increase profitability by becoming efficient.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Efficiency (getting more things done with fewer resources) is directly related to profitability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have to layoff people, its better to let 1 more person go than asking the remaining people to take a pay cut.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have only 1 round of layoffs and assure the rest of the team that everyone remaining is to stay after explaining the reason of the layoff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of giving kids an allowance, give them job list with corresponding pay rates that they can choose from.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="other-quotes"&gt;Other Quotes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Failed entrepreneurs are, in fact, the lucky ones! The majority of the businesses that survive are racking up debt, and their leaders are perpetually stressed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you hit rock bottom, sometimes you get dragged along the bottom, scraping your face on every one of those rocks until you are battered, bruised and bloodied&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A financially healthy company is a result of small daily financial wins, not one big moment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Profitability isn't an event; its a habit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you think you can or think you can't, you're right. - Henry Ford&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Well-dressed poverty is still poverty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Effort is financial cost and time cost&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small questions lead only small answers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Money can always be found through streamlining and innovation, and that begins with asking the big questions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Innovation occurs in small steps, big leaps and everywhere in between&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you make enough money, you don't have to budget&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cash is cash. Either you have it or you don't&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="recommendation"&gt;Recommendation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few topics like Personal Finance, Layoffs and Finance for kids that I think other books are better suited for and could have been avoided. However, the core of the book is a must-read for anyone wanting to own a profitable business. The step by step guide with examples make it very easy to understand the concepts and to apply it to your business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</content:encoded>

			<title>Index card</title>

			<description>This is a well written albeit basic book based on the premise that all the financial advice you need to know can fit on an index card.</description>

			<pubDate>Fri, 24 Apr 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
			<content:encoded>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is based on the premise that all the financial advice you need to know can fit on an index card. The book is broken down into 9 chapters each of which corresponds to a rule on the index card. Each chapter explains how the rule works accompanied with detailed stories and examples. It is a good book to read if you are just starting to get your financial life in order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the advice is US-centric but can be applied to other countries as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="key-quote"&gt;Key Quote&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is your financial life. Take control of it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="key-takeaways"&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="budgeting"&gt;Budgeting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are always worried about your immediate cash flow, you will make mistakes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not wait for more than a week to assign expenses to proper categories in your budget.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dividing every expense into categories allows you to see the big picture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="saving"&gt;Saving&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An emergency fund is a basic foundation for having stability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To gain control over your financial life, pay down the bill with the highest interest rate while paying the required minimum on the rest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save for retirement after funding your emergency fund.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take full advantage of the retirement account match offered by your employer. It is free money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="financial-advice"&gt;Financial Advice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most financial advisors are salespersons or brokers even if their official title is different.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your neighbourhood brokerage or bank is not the place to get unconflicted financial advice. If you want unconflicted financial advice, you almost certainly have to pay for it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A fiduciary is a financial advisor who has a legal and regulatory duty to put your interests ahead of his or her own. They are also known as a certified financial planner (CFP), registered investment advisor (RIA) or fee-only advisor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want to seek out an advisor who works on a fee-only basis. This means the advisor is paid by you and only by you. Never assume someone is a fiduciary. Always ask. You need to ask and ask quite specifically: Do you work to the fiduciary standard at all times? This last part, “at all times” is important.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="investing"&gt;Investing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't fall for stories that you can invest in more funds or that it will be easier to monitor your money if it's all in one place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warren Buffet is an excellent stock picker but he also gets benefits from getting access to deals not available to mere run-of-the-mill investors like the rest of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Alternative investments” is a nice way of saying “This is a risky investment”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diversify so that not everything in your investment portfolio rises and falls by the same amount at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you put money only in supersafe assets that earn low returns you will lose money relative to inflation and increase your risk of outliving your money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Formula to decide how much money to put in stock market funds:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Percentage of your assets invested in stocks = 100 - your current age&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stock investment Breakdown&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;70%: A good S &amp;amp; P 500 index fund for assured quick diversification.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;15%: A small-cap index fund because they have generally outperformed large-cap funds but have a greater risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;15%: A broad-based international fund. Make sure that you choose an international fund and not a global fund.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Optional]&lt;/strong&gt; (5-10%): If you don't own property, a real estate investment trust index fund.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="housing"&gt;Housing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You should spend no more than a third of your take-home pay on housing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finance your emergency fund. Then think about purchasing a home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get your mortgage pre-approved by a bank before you look at the first house.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your house is your home. It is not a speculative investment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are practical benefits to owning your residence but it is almost always a highly leveraged aka risky investment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your interest rate drops by less than one percentage point or if you are planning to move soon, it's not worth refinancing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="insurance"&gt;Insurance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insurance is a complicated but necessary evil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get a thirty-year level term life policy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand exactly what kind of coverage is contained in the policy you are buying. You need to pose worst-case scenarios to the person selling the policy and then make sure to get their answers in writing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go for the high-deductible options when buying insurance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adequate liability insurance is at least twice the amount of your net worth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have a high net worth get umbrella insurance which covers the amount of your potential responsibility if you exhaust your liability insurance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="other-quotes"&gt;Other quotes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simplicity takes work and insight to achieve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the most important biases is the overconfidence that comes with expertise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starvation budgets work no better than starvation diets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's better to save 1 per cent consistently than try and fail over and over again to save 10 to 20 per cent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it’s free, you are the product.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you sit down for cards, and you don’t know who the sucker is it's you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Popular advice is if we just give up a $5 small luxury a day, we can retire millionaires. But if that were all it took, most of us would be millionaires already.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That's the thing about bubbles and great market runs - Anyone can make money. Until times change or the bubble bursts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The three most important things in a real estate purchase are location, location, and location.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="recommendation"&gt;Recommendation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is great if you are just getting started with sorting out your financial life. It explains the different concepts in a very easy to understand way. But for people who are in control of their financial life, this book does not offer anything new.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content:encoded>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book gives a great insight into Elon Musk as a person as well as into his companies. It starts from Elon's childhood and goes right up to the current status quo. It reveals the work ethic, the drive and the ruthlessness that exists within Elon that helps him achieve his goals. As his ex-wife, Justine puts it (in the book) "He does what he wants and he is relentless about it. Its Elon's world and the rest of us live in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vance strikes a perfect balance between the personal and the professional life of Elon. He does not shie away from detailing the various challenges and failures that Elon faced. An interesting thing that I learned was that Elon was the inspiration for Downey's interpretation of Tony Stark. However, I felt that although Elon has been shown as an extremely hard task-master with little empathy for his employees, the negative stories seem to have been glossed over. I wonder if that was to keep the aura of Elon Musk intact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="key-quote"&gt;Key Quote&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think there are probably too many smart people pursuing internet stuff, finance and law. That is part of the reason why we haven't seen as much innovation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;""Elon Musk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="key-takeaways"&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you believe in your goals, even if they might sound absurd at the moment, you might be able to achieve them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes you have to continue even after being told no repeatedly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If rules don't allow you to make progress, you have to fight the rules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you really want to innovate make things from scratch and try to rethink much that is accepted as convention. You can see this with all of Musk's companies in the aerospace, automotive and solar industries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building big things is a messy business. People will either adore you or despise you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't build a Ferrari when an Accord will do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes, you have to build things in-house, to keep costs down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick a plan of attack and if it fails, move on quickly and try a new approach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scarcity reinforces greed and leads to more interest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At some point, being nice to everyone doesn't work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asking the right question is hard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How you are perceived at school, is not an indicator of success.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have to do something that has an effect on the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have to do something you love to be successful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nothing matters, if you don't get the product right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The objective should be - "What delivers fundamental value"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Word of mouth reviews is critical.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always follow through your commitments, even if they are delayed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Problems can be turned into an excuse to show off dedication to pleasing the customer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having investors might result in the company losing its vision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you must rely on investors, try and put a significant amount of money yourself as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes, the person who starts the company is not the right person to lead it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep an eye out and hire keen and bright people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trust people to empower them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get people to own their own work. Then, if they are working hard, they are doing it for themselves, not because you told them to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be careful about how you handle fixing other peoples work. Done incorrectly, It can easily make them unproductive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let people vent it out when they are upset or angry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If running your own company, don't burden your employees with your financial worries. That does not mean stop communicating the importance of being lean and of success.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure you remove the obstacles hindering your employees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If interviewing, talk concretely about what you do rather than use buzzwords.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="other-quotes"&gt;Other quotes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads. That sucks. - Jeff Hammerbacher&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There needs to be a reason for a grade. I'd rather play video games than try and get the A if there is no point. - Elon Musk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The longer you wait to fire someone, the longer it has been since you should have fired them. - Elon Musk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Context matters. Always ask 'How would this sound to [them], knowing what they know? - Elon Musk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good ideas are always crazy until they're not - Larry Page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He does what he wants and he is relentless about it. Its Elon's world and the rest of us live in it - Justine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="recommendation"&gt;Recommendation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book makes for a good read and has some interesting takeaways. However, I think it will be tough to apply them if you do not have a similar personality like Elon. I also didn’t like the fact that it glosses over the people challenges&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think it is a book that I will pick up again and again. However, It is worth reading it at least once&lt;/p&gt;

			<content:encoded>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is about Theranos, a startup making medical devices to enable the testing of blood using just a pinprick. It was at the time a fabled unicorn having a star cast board of members and one of the highest valuations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first part of the book gives an insight into the inner workings of the company and how it was built on a culture of fear and lies.The second part, however talks about how the author got involved and his efforts of getting the story published while the company tried various tactics to intimidate him and his sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its an extremely interesting and well written book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="key-quote"&gt;Key Quote&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what happens when you work to change things. First they think you're crazy, then they fight you, and then all of a sudden you change the world&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Elizabeth Holmes&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="key-takeaways"&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't buy expensive things early in anticipation of when they will be used but closer to when you actually need them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure different groups are talking to each other. Don't be the sole person who has the complete picture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have to lay off people especially top executives, make sure everyone is informed along with the reason and quash any rumours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firing people who raise objections/concerns while promoting others makes a dysfunctional culture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having the right board of directors can give you a stamp of legitimacy and lend credence to your assertions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are investing money, do your due diligence. Preferably, have some knowledge of the industry or area.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't ignore customers and promptly own/apologize for your mistakes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="other-quotes"&gt;Other quotes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You cannot run a company through fear and intimidation...it will only work for a period of time before it collapses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="recommendation"&gt;Recommendation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering that John is a professional writer, it comes as no surprise that the book is a compelling read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one misgiving I have about the book is that it mostly talked about the mistakes that were made and ignores the things that were done right. It would have been nice to read about some of the things that were done right. However, they fall into the realm of how Elizabeth holmes conned the various parties. The only praise that I could find in the book for her is along of the lines of that she is an amazing salesperson who is smart, inspiring and energising. Personally, I feel that for a company to reach that size both in the number of employees and the valuation, it's not possible that only mistakes were made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it did not have much in the way of takeaways, it was still an interesting and well written book to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</content:encoded>

			<content:encoded>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very well written book and gives an extremely good insight into Pixar's struggle to become a blockbuster factory and its process of raising an IPO. Apart from that it also painted a completely different picture of Steve Job's style of working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="key-quote"&gt;Key Quote&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is nothing you can do about where the pieces are. It's only your next move that matters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="key-takeaways"&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take things one step at a time. Not all steps require you to take the final decision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look for someone you can work with and learn from.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at the business the way a grandmaster looks at a chessboard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Innovation depends on culture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tiny startups beat big companies because of the culture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mentors you can trust to give you the right advice when you need a sanity check are important.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are 2 key things you need to get a good deal
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leverage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; i.e the assessment of the bargaining power or the strength of the actual hand you have&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Negotiation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; i.e. how you put the bargaining power to work for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's helpful to see what leverage you and the other party have in one place before going into a negotiation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be crystal clear of what you want out of the negotiation. Don't have a backup position for things that are important to you. However, there a risk of over-reaching so that you end up with nothing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes a leader has to take the hit to get something meaningful done for the rest of the team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have to find the Middle Way - the balance between &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;structure&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; i.e the bureaucrat and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;fluidity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; i.e the artist irrespective of whether its personal or business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="recomendation"&gt;Recomendation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you are not interested in the movie or animation business, this book is a must-read. It was hard to put down and had some great takeaways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</content:encoded>
