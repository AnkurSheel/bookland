        <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The book is based on the premise that all the financial advice you need to know can fit on an index card. The book is broken down into 9 chapters each of which corresponds to a rule on the index card. Each chapter explains how the rule works accompanied with detailed stories and examples. It is a good book to read if you are just starting to get your financial life in order.</p>
<p>Some of the advice is US-centric but can be applied to other countries as well.</p>
<h2 id="key-quote">Key Quote</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This is your financial life. Take control of it</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="key-takeaways">Key Takeaways</h2>
<h3 id="budgeting">Budgeting</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you are always worried about your immediate cash flow, you will make mistakes.</li>
<li>Do not wait for more than a week to assign expenses to proper categories in your budget.</li>
<li>Dividing every expense into categories allows you to see the big picture.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="saving">Saving</h3>
<ul>
<li>An emergency fund is a basic foundation for having stability.</li>
<li>To gain control over your financial life, pay down the bill with the highest interest rate while paying the required minimum on the rest.</li>
<li>Save for retirement after funding your emergency fund.</li>
<li>Take full advantage of the retirement account match offered by your employer. It is free money.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="financial-advice">Financial Advice</h3>
<ul>
<li>Most financial advisors are salespersons or brokers even if their official title is different.</li>
<li>Your neighbourhood brokerage or bank is not the place to get unconflicted financial advice. If you want unconflicted financial advice, you almost certainly have to pay for it.</li>
<li>A fiduciary is a financial advisor who has a legal and regulatory duty to put your interests ahead of his or her own. They are also known as a certified financial planner (CFP), registered investment advisor (RIA) or fee-only advisor.</li>
<li>You want to seek out an advisor who works on a fee-only basis. This means the advisor is paid by you and only by you. Never assume someone is a fiduciary. Always ask. You need to ask and ask quite specifically: Do you work to the fiduciary standard at all times? This last part, “at all times” is important.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="investing">Investing</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Don't fall for stories that you can invest in more funds or that it will be easier to monitor your money if it's all in one place.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Warren Buffet is an excellent stock picker but he also gets benefits from getting access to deals not available to mere run-of-the-mill investors like the rest of us.</p>
</li>
<li><p>“Alternative investments” is a nice way of saying “This is a risky investment”</p>
</li>
<li><p>Diversify so that not everything in your investment portfolio rises and falls by the same amount at the same time.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you put money only in supersafe assets that earn low returns you will lose money relative to inflation and increase your risk of outliving your money.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Formula to decide how much money to put in stock market funds:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Percentage of your assets invested in stocks = 100 - your current age</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Stock investment Breakdown</p>
<ul>
<li>70%: A good S &amp; P 500 index fund for assured quick diversification.</li>
<li>15%: A small-cap index fund because they have generally outperformed large-cap funds but have a greater risk.</li>
<li>15%: A broad-based international fund. Make sure that you choose an international fund and not a global fund.</li>
<li><strong>[Optional]</strong> (5-10%): If you don't own property, a real estate investment trust index fund.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="housing">Housing</h3>
<ul>
<li>You should spend no more than a third of your take-home pay on housing.</li>
<li>Finance your emergency fund. Then think about purchasing a home.</li>
<li>Get your mortgage pre-approved by a bank before you look at the first house.</li>
<li>Your house is your home. It is not a speculative investment.</li>
<li>There are practical benefits to owning your residence but it is almost always a highly leveraged aka risky investment.</li>
<li>If your interest rate drops by less than one percentage point or if you are planning to move soon, it's not worth refinancing.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="insurance">Insurance</h3>
<ul>
<li>Insurance is a complicated but necessary evil.</li>
<li>Get a thirty-year level term life policy.</li>
<li>Understand exactly what kind of coverage is contained in the policy you are buying. You need to pose worst-case scenarios to the person selling the policy and then make sure to get their answers in writing.</li>
<li>Go for the high-deductible options when buying insurance.</li>
<li>Adequate liability insurance is at least twice the amount of your net worth.</li>
<li>If you have a high net worth get umbrella insurance which covers the amount of your potential responsibility if you exhaust your liability insurance.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other-quotes">Other quotes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Simplicity takes work and insight to achieve.</li>
<li>One of the most important biases is the overconfidence that comes with expertise.</li>
<li>Starvation budgets work no better than starvation diets.</li>
<li>It's better to save 1 per cent consistently than try and fail over and over again to save 10 to 20 per cent.</li>
<li>If it’s free, you are the product.</li>
<li>If you sit down for cards, and you don’t know who the sucker is it's you.</li>
<li>Popular advice is if we just give up a $5 small luxury a day, we can retire millionaires. But if that were all it took, most of us would be millionaires already.</li>
<li>That's the thing about bubbles and great market runs - Anyone can make money. Until times change or the bubble bursts.</li>
<li>The three most important things in a real estate purchase are location, location, and location.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="recommendation">Recommendation</h2>
<p>This book is great if you are just getting started with sorting out your financial life. It explains the different concepts in a very easy to understand way. But for people who are in control of their financial life, this book does not offer anything new.</p>
