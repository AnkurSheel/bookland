## Key Quote

> Money has a little to do with how smart you are and a lot to do with how you behave

## Key Takeaways

### Understanding Success and Failure Patterns

In the financial world, news is dominated by extreme examples. These examples highlight exceptional gains that come from a fraction of actions.

> The more you want something to be true, the more likely you are to believe a story that overestimates the odds of it being true.

We need to remember that these only apply to some situations. We should instead look for the typical patterns of success and failure.

### The Roles of Luck and Risk

> Life is about playing the odds, and we all think about odds a little differently

Besides individual effort, luck and risk play significant roles in life. They delineate the fine line between boldness and recklessness.

While luck can pave the way for success, it is frequently disregarded as a critical factor in success.

Accepting luck's role in personal success can feel demoralising, and suggesting that another person's success is because of luck makes us look jealous and mean.

> Risk is whats left over when you think you've thought of everything.
>
> ""Carl Richards""

Risk is when things don't go as planned. It is frequently misunderstood as poor decision-making even though no endeavour guarantees 100% success.

> There is no reason to risk what you have and need for what you don't have and don't need

However, it is important to remember that essential aspects like reputation, freedom, family, and happiness are not worth risking.

### Wealth Creation and Preservation

Even though the quality of education and the doors that open for us are heavily linked to our parents' socioeconomic status, pursuing financial gains and acquiring wealth involves taking risks.

> There are a million ways to get wealthy. But there's only one way to stay wealthy: some combination of frugality and paranoia

Safeguarding and preserving that hard-earned money demands a persistent fear â€” a fear that what we've gathered might vanish.

> Past a certain level of income, people fall into three groups: Those who save, those who don't think they can save, and those who don't think they need to save.

Contrary to popular belief, the size of our income plays a minor role compared to our savings rate. It's about resisting the urge to spend immediately, paving the way for more choices and opportunities in the future.

> All lifestyles exist on a spectrum, and what is decent to one person can feel like royalty or poverty to another

Accepting that we might have enough shields us from falling into the trap of ceaseless social comparison, an endless pursuit without boundaries or satisfaction.

### The Importance of Having Room for Error

> Things that have never happened before happen all the time.
>
> ""Scott Sagan""

Many decisions rely on precise conditions for success. This insistence on everything falling into place perfectly contributes to their downfall, even if the core idea was correct.

Having a margin of safety significantly improves the chances of success by accounting for unforeseen circumstances.

### Understanding Market Bubbles

Individuals have distinct goals and time horizons when it comes to investments. It leads them to prioritise different aspects when making investment decisions.

> Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can't lose.
>
> "Bill Gates"

Market bubbles materialise as a result of individuals engaging in short-term trading practices, driven by the desire to capture and exploit the ever-growing momentum within the market

However, the real damage of these bubbles manifests when long-term investors, playing a separate investment game altogether, begin adopting the techniques employed by short-term traders.

### The Power of Compounding

> An interesting quirk of investing history is that the further back you look, the more likely you are to be examining a world that no longer applies to today

The highest returns in investment are often singular occurrences and not consistently reproducible.

> Do not aim to be coldly rational when making financial decisions. Aim to just be pretty reasonable.

Contrary to common misconceptions, compounding doesn't rely on obtaining extraordinary returns but rather on obtaining steady, moderate returns over an extended timeframe.

> It is not necessarily the amount of snow that causes ice sheets but the fact that snow, however little, lasts
>
> ""Gwen Schultz""

Achieving success through compounding requires investors to endure for extended periods without encountering substantial losses or being forced to liquidate their investments prematurely.

Granting compounding the necessary years or decades is essential for optimal results.

### Unique Decision-making

> When you make decisions for reasons that I can't even comprehend, I might follow you blindly into a decision that is right for you and disastrous to me.

The decisions made by others might appear puzzling or illogical, yet these choices are a product of their unique life experiences. Every individual's decision-making is heavily influenced by their life journey, which in turn influences their viewpoints and actions.

> Some lessons have to be experienced before they can be understood
>
> ""Michael Batnick""

Additionally, despite the desire to assess the wisdom behind certain decisions, the complexity of human decision-making poses a significant challenge. This difficulty leads to oversimplified narratives that offer a simplistic view but fail to encapsulate the complexity and nuances of real-life decision-making processes.

### The Importance of Flexibility

> The man who can do the average thing when all those around him are going crazy
>
> ""Napoleon""

Napoleon's definition of a military genius holds profound wisdom beyond the battlefield.

This sentiment echoes the significance of adaptability in a world abundant with intellect. Flexibility emerges as a strategic advantage, allowing for patience and discernment in decision-making.

### Balanced Approach in Life and Finance

> True success is exiting some rat race to modulate ones activities for peace of mind
>
> ""Nassim Taleb""

Achieving financial success isn't solely about accumulating wealth. Ensuring that our financial decisions provide us with peace of mind is a key aspect of successful money management.

> Everything has a price, and the key to a lot of things with money is just figuring out what that price is and being willing to pay it. The problem is that the price of a lot of things is not obvious until you have experienced them firsthand when the bill is overdue

However, success comes at a cost, and acknowledging and preparing to pay this price is vital.
Stopping the goalpost from constantly shifting is one of the most challenging financial skills to master

In a world where capitalism excels in generating both wealth and envy, it's crucial to have moderate annual savings, moderate free time, moderate commute, and moderate time with the family. This not only bolsters the ability to adhere to plans but also reduces the likelihood of regret

### Perception of Success

> There is no faster way to feel rich than to spend lots of money on really nice things. But the way to be rich is to spend money you have, and to not spend money you dont have
>
> ""Bill Mann""

The desire to become a millionaire often stems from a fascination with spending rather than saving. Ironically, the wish to spend a million dollars contradicts the essence of attaining millionaire status.

Similarly, coveting luxurious possessions like fancy cars or high-end watches might mask a deeper longing for respect and admiration. Contrary to common perception, these virtues are better acquired through acts of kindness and humility rather than flaunting opulent possessions.

## Other Quotes

> History never repeats itself; man always does
>
> ""Voltaire""

> Optimism sounds like a sales pitch. Pessimism sounds like someone trying to help you. Real optimists dont believe that everything will be great. That's complacency. Optimism is a belief that the odds of a good outcome are in your favor over time, even when there will be setbacks along the way.

> Every job looks easy when you are not the one doing it
>
> ""Jeff Immelt""

> While conservatism in a bullish market might feel counterintuitive, its value lies in averting rash actions during bearish trends.

> I did not intend to get rich. I just wanted to get independent.
>
> ""Charlie Munger""

> We need to believe we live in a predictable, controllable world, so we turn to authoritative-sounding people who promise to satisfy that need
>
> ""Philip Tetlock""

> It's not whether you're right or wrong that's important, but how much money you make when you're right and how much you lose when you're wrong
>
> ""George Soros""


> You can be risk loving and yet completely averse to ruin.
>
> ""Nassim Taleb""
